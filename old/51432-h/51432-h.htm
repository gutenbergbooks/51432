<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p>Scheherazadè, the heroine of the Thousand and
one Nights, ranks among the great story-tellers
of the world much as does Penelope among the
weavers. Procrastination was the basis of her
art; for though the task she accomplished was
splendid and memorable, it is rather in the
quantity than the quality of her invention&mdash;in
the long spun-out performance of what could
have been done far more shortly&mdash;that she
becomes a figure of dramatic interest. The idea
which binds the stories together is greater and
more romantic than the stories themselves; and
though, both in the original and in translation,
the diurnal interruption of their flow is more and
more taken for granted, we are never quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>robbed of the sense that it is Scheherazadè who
is speaking&mdash;Scheherazadè, loquacious and self-possessed,
sitting up in bed at the renewed call
of dawn to save her neck for the round of another
day. Here is a figure of romance worth a dozen
of the prolix stories to which it has been made
sponsor; and often we may have followed the
fortunes of some shoddy hero and heroine
chiefly to determine at what possible point of
interest the narrator could have left hanging that
frail thread on which for another twenty-four
hours her life was to depend.</p>

<p>Yes, the idea is delightful; and, with the fiction
of Scheherazadè to colour them, the tales acquire
a rank which they would not otherwise deserve;
their prolixity is then the crowning point of their
art, their sententious truisms have a flavour of
ironic wit, their repetitions become humorous,
their trivialities a mark of light-hearted courage;
even those deeper indiscretions, which Burton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>has so faithfully recorded, seem then but a wise
adaptation of vile means to a noble end. And yet
we know that it is not so; for, as a matter of
fact, the "Arabian Nights Entertainment" is but a
miscellany gathered from various sources, of various
dates, and passing down to us, even in its
collocated form, under widely differing versions.
None but scholars can know how little of the
unadulterated originals has come into our possession;
and only those whose pious opinions
shut their eyes to obvious facts can object in
principle to the simplification of a form which,
from the point of view of mere story-telling, can
so easily be bettered. Even the more accurate of
the versions ordinarily available are full of
abridgement, alteration, and suppression; and if
you have to eliminate Scheherazadè and select
your stories mainly with a view to illustration,
then you have very largely done away with the
reasons for treating tenderly that prolixity which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>in an impatient age tends to debar readers from
an old classic.</p>

<p>And so, in the present version, whoever shall
care to make comparison will find that
the original material has been treated with
considerable freedom in the direction of brevity,
and with an almost uniform departure from the
exact text, save where essentials of plot or character
or local colour required a closer, accuracy.
In the case also of conflicting versions, there has
been no reluctance to choose and combine in
order to secure a livelier result; and a further
freedom has sometimes been taken of giving to
an incident more meaning and connexion than
has been allowed to it in the original. That is,
perhaps, the greatest licence of all, but it is the
one that does least harm in formal result; for
no one can read the majority of the tales in their
accepted versions without perceiving that, as
regards construction and the piecing of event
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>with event, they are either incredibly careless or
discreditably perfunctory. We have to reckon
with them as the product of a race keenly alive
to the value of colour and pictorial description,
but a race whose constructive imagination was
feeble and diffuse, lacking almost entirely that
great essential for the development of art in its
finer forms&mdash;the economy of means toward ends.</p>

<p>But because they contain, though at a low
pressure, the expression of so much life, habit
and custom, so many coloured and secluded
interiors, so quaint a commingling of crowds,
so brilliant and moving a pageantry of Eastern
mediævalism, because of all these things the
"Arabian Nights" will still retain their perennial
charm. Those of us who read are all travellers;
and never is our travelling sense so awakened
perhaps, as when we dip into a book such
as this where the incredible and the common-place
are so curiously blended, and where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>Jinn and Efreet and Magician have far less interest
for us now than the silly staring crowds,
and the bobbing camels in the narrow streets, and
Scheherazadè spinning her poor thin yarn of
wonders that she may share for another night the
pillow of a homicidal maniac.</p>

<h2>THE FISHERMAN AND THE
GENIE</h2>

<p class="p2">There was once an old fisherman who lived in
great poverty with a wife and three children.
But though poorer than others he ever toiled in
humble submission to the decrees of Providence,
and so, at the same hour each day, he would
cast his net four times into the sea, and whatever
it brought up to him therewith he rested
content.</p>

<p>One day, having cast for the first time, he
found his net so heavy that he could scarcely
draw it in; yet when at last he got it to shore
all that it contained was the carcase of an ass.</p>

<p>He cast a second time, and found the draught
of the net even heavier than before. But again
he was doomed to disappointment, for this time
it contained nothing but a large earthenware
jar full of mud and sand. His third attempt
brought him only a heap of broken old bottles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>and potsherds: fortune seemed to be against
him. Then, committing his hope to Providence,
he cast for the fourth and last time; and once
more the weight of the net was so great that he
was unable to haul it. When at last he got it
to land, he found that it contained a brazen
vessel, its mouth closed with a leaden stopper,
bearing upon it the seal of King Solomon.</p>

<p>The sight cheered him. "This," thought he,
"I can sell in the market, where I may get for
it enough to buy a measure of corn; and, if one
is to judge by weight, what lies within may
prove yet more valuable."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl02"></a><a href="images/lg_pl02.jpg">
<img src="images/pl02.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">And there in its midst stood a mighty Genie.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Thus reckoning, he prised out the stopper with
his knife, and turning the vessel upside down
looked for the contents to follow. Great was
his astonishment when nothing but smoke came
out of it. The smoke rose in a thick black
column and spread like a mist between earth
and sky, till presently, drawing together, it took
form; and there in its midst stood a mighty
Genie, whose brows touched heaven while his
feet rested upon ground. His head was like a
dome, his hands were like flails, and his legs
like pine trees; his mouth was black as a cavern,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>his nostrils were like trumpets, his eyes blazed
like torches, and his wings whirled round and
over him like the simoom of the desert.</p>

<p>At so fearful a sight all the fisherman's courage
oozed out of him; but the Genie, perceiving
him, cried with a loud voice, "O, Solomon,
Prophet of God, slay me not, for never again
will I withstand thee in word or deed!"</p>

<p>"Alas!" said the fisherman, "I am no
prophet; and as for Solomon, he has been dead
for nearly two thousand years. I am but a poor
fisherman whom chance has knocked by accident
against thy door."</p>

<p>"In that case," answered the Genie, "know
that presently thou wilt have to die."</p>

<p>"Heaven forbid!" cried the fisherman; "or,
at least, tell me why! Surely it might seem that
I had done thee some service in releasing thee."</p>

<p>"Hear first my story," said the Genie, "then
shalt thou understand."</p>

<p>"Well, if I must!" said the fisherman, resigning
himself to the inevitable; "but make it
short, for truly I have small stomach left in me
now for the hearing of tales."</p>

<p>"Know, then," said the Genie, "that I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>one of those spirits which resisted the power
and dominion of Solomon; and when, having
brought into submission all the rest of my
race, he could not make me yield to him either
reverence or service, he caused me to be
shut up in this bottle, and sealing it with
his own seal cast it down into the depths of
the sea.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp" >
<a id="pl03"></a><a href="images/lg_pl03.jpg">
<img src="images/pl03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">When having brought into submission
all the rest of my race.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>"Now when I had lain there prisoner for a
hundred years, I swore in my heart that I would
give to the man that should release me all the
treasures attainable in heaven or earth. But
when none came to earn so great a reward in all
the hundred years that followed, then I swore
that I would give to my liberator earthly riches
only; and when this gift also had lain despised
for yet another hundred years, then would I
promise no more than the fulfilment of three
wishes. But thereafter finding that all promises
and vows were vain, my heart became consumed
with rage, and I swore by Allah that I would
only grant to the fool that should release me his
own choice of the most cruel form of death by
which he should die. Now therefore accept that
mercy which I still offer and choose thy penalty!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>When the fisherman heard this he gave himself
up for lost, yet he did not the less continue
by prayer and supplication to entreat the Genie
from his purpose. But when he found that
there was no heart left in him to be moved,
then for the first time he bestirred his wits, and
remembering how that which is evil contains far
less wisdom than that which is good, and so
falls ever the more readily into the trap prepared
for it, he spoke thus: "O Genie, since thou art
determined on my death, there is yet a certain
thing touching thine honour that I would first
know. So, by the Ineffable Name, which is the
seal of Solomon, I will ask thee one question,
and do thou swear to answer it truly."</p>

<p>The Genie was ready enough to give the oath
as desired. Then said the fisherman, "How
is it that one so great as thou art, whose feet
o'er-step the hills and whose head out-tops the
heaven&mdash;how can such an one enter into so
small a vessel to dwell in it? Truly, though
mine eyes tell me I have seen it, I cannot any
longer believe so great a marvel."</p>

<p>"What?" cried the Genie, "dost thou not
believe what I have already told thee?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>"Not till I have seen it done can I believe
it," said the fisherman.</p>

<p>Thereupon, without more waste of words,
the Genie, drawing his limbs together and folding
himself once more in a thick veil of smoke,
descended from his vast altitude into the narrow
neck of the brazen vessel till not one shred or
film of him remained to view. Then the fisherman
with a quick hand replaced the leaden
stopper, and laughing, cried to the Genie,
"Choose now, thou in thy turn, by what manner
of death thou wilt die."</p>

<p>The Genie, hearing himself thus mocked, made
violent efforts to escape; but the power of the
seal of Solomon held him fast, and the fisherman,
ceasing not all the while to revile him for
the treachery and baseness which were now to
receive their due reward, began to carry the
vessel back to the sea's brink. "Now," said
he, "thou shalt return to the place whence I
drew thee! And here on the shore I will build
myself a hut, and to every fisherman that comes
near I will say, 'Look that you fish not in these
waters, for herein lies bound a wicked genie that
has sworn to put to a cruel death whoever dares
to release him.'"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>"Nay, nay," cried the Genie, "I did not mean
what I said! Ask of me now, and I will give
you all the treasures that the world contains, or
that your heart can find in it to desire, if only
you will set me free!"</p>

<p>The fisherman, being of a mild spirit and
with no heart for revenge, sat down to consider
what he should do, and all the while the imprisoned
Genie continued to appeal to him for
compassion with loud promise and lamentation.
So at last, the fisherman, having the fear of
God before his eyes, after he had extracted
from the Genie a most solemn vow to leave
him unharmed, drew out the stopper of lead
and released him.</p>

<p>No sooner was he out and restored to his
true form than the Genie, turning himself about,
lifted his foot and with his full strength smote
the brazen vessel far out to sea; and the fisherman,
beholding that act, began to repent him
of his mercy and to tremble again for dear life.</p>

<p>But the Genie, seeing his fear, broke into
huge laughter, and striding on ahead of him
cried, "Come, fisherman, and follow me, for
now I will lead you to fortune!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Meekly at his heels went the old fisherman,
and leaving behind them the habitations of men
they ascended a mountain and entered upon a
desert tract guarded by four hills, in the centre
of which lay a broad lake. Here the Genie
stopped, and pointing to a place where fish
were swimming in abundance bade the fisherman
cast in his net. The fisherman did as he
was told, and when he drew in his net he found
that it contained four fish each of a different
colour, a red, a white, a blue, and a yellow:
never in his life had he seen the like of them.
The Genie bade him take and offer them to
the Sultan, assuring him that if he did so they
should bring him both fortune and honours.
Then he struck the ground with his foot, and
immediately the earth opened its mouth and
swallowed him as the dry desert swallows the
rain.</p>

<p>The fisherman, wondering no less at his safe
deliverance than at the marvel of these occurrences,
made his way in haste to the city; and there
presenting himself at the palace he begged that
the four fish might be laid at the Sultan's feet, as a
humble offering from the poorest of his subjects.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>No sooner had the monarch seen them, so
strange of form and so brilliant and diverse
in hue, than his longing to taste of them
became strongly awakened; so, by the hand of
his Vizier, he sent them to the cook to be
prepared forthwith for the royal table. As for
the poor fisherman, he received no fewer than
four hundred pieces of gold from the Sultan's
bounty, and returned to his family rejoicing in
an affluence which surpassed his utmost expectations.</p>

<p class="caption">No sooner had the monarch seen them, so

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The cook meanwhile, proud of an opportunity
to exhibit her culinary skill on dainties so rare,
scaled and cleaned the fish and laid them in a
frying-pan over the fire. But scarcely had she
done so when the wall of the kitchen divided,
and there issued forth from it a damsel of
moon-like beauty richly apparelled, holding a rod
of myrtle in her hand. With this she struck
the fish that lay in the frying-pan, and cried&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O fish of my pond,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are ye true to your bond?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And immediately the four fishes lifted their
heads from the frying fat and answered&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Even so, the bond holds yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Paid by thee, we pay the debt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With give and take is the reckoning met."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thereupon the damsel upset the pan into the fire
and retired through the wall in the same way
that she had come, leaving the four fish all
charred to a cinder.</p>

<p class="caption">Whereupon one upset the pan into the fire.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The cook, beholding her labour thus brought
to naught, began to weep and bewail herself,
expecting no less than instant dismissal, and was
still loud in her lamentations when the Vizier
arrived to see if the fish were ready.</p>

<p class="caption">Recalling the fisherman by a swift messenger.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>On hearing her account of what had occurred,
the Vizier was greatly astonished, but feared to
bring so strange a report to the Sultan's ears
while the cravings of the royal appetite were
still unsatisfied; so recalling the fisherman by
a swift messenger, he bade him procure in all
haste four more fish of the same kind, promising
to reward him according to the speed with which
he accomplished the task. So spurred, and by the
additional favour of fortune, the fisherman fulfilled
his mission in an astonishingly short space
of time; but no sooner was the second lot of
fish placed upon the fire in the Vizier's presence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>than once again the wall opened, and the damsel,
appearing as before, struck the frying-pan with
her rod, and cried&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O fish of my pond,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are ye true to your bond?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And immediately the fish stood up on their tails
in the frying fat and replied&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Even so, the bond holds yet;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Paid by thee, we pay the debt.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With give and take is the reckoning met."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Whereupon she upset the pan into the fire and
departed as she had come.</p>

<p>The Vizier, perceiving that so strange an event
might no longer be kept from the royal knowledge,
went and informed the Sultan of all that
had occurred; and the monarch, as soon as he
had heard the tale, now rendered more eager for
the satisfaction of his eyes than he had previously
been for the indulgence of his appetite,
sent for the fisherman, and promised him yet
another four hundred pieces of gold if he could
within a given time procure four more fishes
similar to those he had already brought on the
previous occasions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>If the fisherman had been prompt at the
Vizier's bidding, he made even greater speed to
fulfil the royal command, and before the day was
over&mdash;this time in the presence of the Sultan
himself&mdash;four fish, of four diverse colours like
to the first, were cleaned and laid into the pan
ready for frying. But scarcely had they touched
the fat when the wall opened in a clap like
thunder, and there came forth with a face of
rage a monstrous negro the size of a bull, holding
in his hand the rod of myrtle. With this
he struck the frying-pan, and cried in a terrible
voice&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O fish from the pond,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are ye true to your bond?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And when the fish had returned the same
answer that the others had made before them,
without more ado the negro overturned the pan
upon the fire and departed as he had come.</p>

<p>When the Sultan's eyes had seen that marvel,
he said to his Vizier, "Here is mystery set
before us! Surely these fish that talk have a
past and a history. Never shall I rest satisfied
until I have learned it." So causing the fisherman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>to be brought before him, he inquired
whence the fish came. The fisherman answered,
"From a lake between four hills upon the
mountain overlooking the city." The Sultan
inquired how many days' journey it might be,
and the fisherman replied that it was but a
matter of a few hours going and returning.
Then to the Sultan and his court it seemed that
the old man was mocking them, for none had
heard tell of any lake lying among the hills so
near to that city; and the fisherman, seeing his
word doubted, began to fear that the Genie was
playing him a trick; for if the lake were now
suddenly to vanish away, he might find his
fortunes more undone at the end than at the
beginning.</p>

<p>Yet the Sultan, though his Vizier and all his
court sought to dissuade him, was firmly resolved
on putting the matter to the proof; so he gave
orders that an escort and camping tents should
be immediately got ready, and, with the fisherman
to guide, set forth to find the place that was
told of.</p>

<p>And, sure enough, when they had ascended
the mountain which all knew, they came upon a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>desert tract on which no man had previously
set eyes; and there in its midst lay the lake
filled with four kinds of fish, and beyond it
stretched a vast and unknown country.</p>

</div>
<p class="caption">He arrived within sight of a palace of
shining marble.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>At this sight, so mysterious and unaccountable,
of a strange region lying unbeknownst at
the gates of his own capital, the monarch was
seized with an overwhelming desire to press
forward in solitary adventure to the discovery
of its secret. To the cautious counsels of his
Vizier he turned a deaf ear; but since it would
not be safe for his subjects to know of his
departure on an errand so perilous, it was given
out that he had been stricken by sudden sickness.
The door of the royal tent was closed,
and at the dead of night the Sultan, admitting
none but the Vizier into his confidence, set out
secretly on his adventure.</p>

<p>Journeying by night and resting by day, he
arrived on the third morning within sight of a
palace of shining marble which, with its crowd
of domes and minarets, stood solitary among the
hills. No sign of life was about it, and when
he drew near and knocked at the gates none
came to answer him. Then, finding the doors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>unfastened, he took courage and entered; and
advancing through chambers where gold lay as
dust, and by fountains wherein pearls lay poured
out like water, he found only solitude to greet
him.</p>

<p>Wandering without aim among innumerable
treasures unguarded and left to waste, the Sultan
grew weary, and sat down in an embrasure to
rest. Then it seemed to him that not far off he
could hear a sorrowful voice chant verses of
lamentation. Following the sounds with wonder
he came to a curtained doorway, and passing
through found himself in the presence of a fair
youth richly dressed, seated upon a couch and
bearing upon his countenance tokens of extreme
grief and despondency. To the Sultan's proffered
greeting the youth returned salutation, but did
not stir from his seat. "Pardon me," he said,
"for not rising; but my miserable condition
makes it impossible." Having said this he
again broke into doleful lamentation; and when
the Sultan inquired as to the cause of so many
tears, "See for yourself," he cried, "what I am
now made into!" And lifting the skirt of his
robe he revealed himself all stone from his waist
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>to the soles of his feet, while from the waist
upwards he was as other men. Then as he
observed upon his visitor's countenance the
expression of a lively curiosity and astonishment,
"Doubtless," he went on, "as you now
know the secret of my miserable condition you
will wish also to hear my story." And he related
it as follows:&mdash;</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE KING OF THE EBONY ISLES</h2>

<p class="caption">The Queen of the Ebony Isles.</p>

<hr class="r35" />


<p>"My father was king of the city which once
stood about this palace. He was lord also of the
Ebony Isles that are now the four hills which
you passed on your way hither. When I succeeded
to the throne upon his death, I took to
wife my own cousin, the daughter of my uncle,
with whom I lived for five years in the utmost
confidence and felicity, continually entertained
by the charm of her conversation and the beauty
of her person, and happy in the persuasion that
she found in me an equal satisfaction.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl09"></a><a href="images/lg_pl09.jpg">

</div>
<p class="caption">Supposing me asleep they began to talk.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>"One day, however, it chanced, in the hour
before dinner when the queen was gone to bathe
and adorn herself, that I lay upon a couch beside
which two female slaves sat fanning me; and
they, supposing me to be asleep, began to talk
concerning me and their mistress. 'Ah!' said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>one, 'how little our lord knows where our
mistress goes to amuse herself every night while
he lies dreaming!' 'How should he know?'
returned the other, 'seeing that the cup of wine
which she gives him each night contains a
sleeping-draught, that causes him to sleep sound
however long she is absent. Then at daybreak
when she returns she burns perfumes under his
nostrils, and he waking and finding her there
guesses nothing. Pity it is that he cannot know
of her treacherous ways, for surely it is a shame
that a king's wife should go abroad and mix
with base people.'</p>


<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl10"></a><a href="images/lg_pl10.jpg">
<img src="images/pl10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">The cup of wine which she gives him
each night contains a sleeping-draught.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>"Now when I heard this the light of day grew
dark before my eyes; but I lay on and made no
sign, awaiting my wife's return. And she coming
in presently, we sat down and ate and drank
together according to custom; and afterwards,
when I had retired and lain down, she brought
me with her own hands the cup of spiced wine,
inviting me to drink. Then I, averting myself,
raised it to my lips, but instead of drinking,
poured it by stealth into my bosom, and immediately
sank down as though overcome by its
potency, feigning slumber. Straightway the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>queen rose up from my side, and having clothed
herself in gorgeous apparel and anointed herself
with perfumes, she made her way secretly from
the palace, and I with equal secrecy followed her.</p>

<p>"Soon, passing by way of the narrower streets,
we arrived before the city gates; and immediately
at a word from her the chains fell and the
gates opened of their own accord, closing again
behind us as soon as we had passed. At last
she came to a ruined hut, and there entering I
saw her presently with her veil laid aside, seated
in familiar converse with a monstrous negro, the
meanest and most vile of slaves, offering to him
in abject servility dainties which she had carried
from the royal table, and bestowing upon him
every imaginable token of affection and regard.</p>

<p>"At this discovery I fell into a blind rage, and
drawing my sword I rushed in and struck the
slave from behind a blow upon the neck that
should have killed him. Then believing that I
had verily slain him, and before the queen found
eyes to realize what had befallen, I departed under
cover of night as quickly as I had come, and
returned to the palace and my own chamber.</p>

<p>"On awaking the next morning I found the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>queen lying beside me as though nothing had
happened, and at first I was ready to believe it
had all been an evil dream; but presently I
perceived her eyes red with weeping, her hair
dishevelled, and her face torn by the passion of
a grief which she strove to conceal. Having
thus every reason to believe that my act of
vengeance had not fallen short of its purpose, I
held my tongue and made no sign.</p>

<p>"But the same day at noon, while I sat in
council, the queen appeared before me clad in
deep mourning, and with many tears informed
me how she had received sudden news of the
death of her father and mother and two brothers,
giving full and harrowing details of each event.
Without any show of incredulity I heard her
tale; and when she besought my permission to
go into retirement and mourn in a manner
befitting so great a calamity, I bade her do as
she desired.</p>

<p>"So for a whole year she continued to mourn
in a privacy which I left undisturbed; and during
that time she caused to be built a mausoleum
or Temple of Lamentation&mdash;the same whose
dome you see yonder&mdash;into which she withdrew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>herself from all society; while I, believing the
cause of my anger removed and willing to
humour the grief which my act had caused her,
waited patiently for her return to a sane and
reasonable state of mind.</p>

<p>"But, as I learned too late, matters had not so
fallen: for though in truth the negro was grievously
wounded, being cut through the gullet
and speechless, it was not the will of Heaven
that he should die; and the queen having by
her enchantments kept him in a sort of life, no
sooner was the mausoleum finished than she
caused him to be secretly conveyed thither, and
there night and day tended him, awaiting his
full recovery.</p>

<p>"At length, when two years were over and her
mourning in no wise abated, my curiosity became
aroused; so going one day to the Temple of
Lamentation I entered unannounced, and placing
myself where I might see and not be seen, there
I discovered her in an abandonment of fond
weeping over her miserable treasure whose very
life was a dishonour to us both. But no sooner
in my just resentment had I started to upbraid
her, than she&mdash;as now for the first time realizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>the cause of her companion's misfortune&mdash;began
to heap upon me terms of the most violent and
shameful abuse; and when, carried beyond
myself, I threatened her with my sword, she
stood up before me, and having first uttered
words of unknown meaning she cried,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Be thou changed in a moment's span;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Half be marble, and half be man!'<br /></span>

</div>
<p class="caption">She went on to vent her malice upon the
city and islands.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>And at the word I became even as you see
me now&mdash;dead to the waist, and above living
yet bound. Yet even so her vengeance was
not satisfied. Having reduced me to this state
she went on to vent her malice upon the city
and islands over which I ruled, and the unfortunate
people who were my subjects. Thus by
her wicked machinations the city became a lake,
and the islands about it the four hills which
you have seen; as for the inhabitants, who
were of four classes and creeds, Moslems,
Christians, Jews, and Persians, she turned them
into fish of four different colours: the white
are the Moslems, the red are Persian fire-worshippers,
the yellow are Jews, and the blue
Christians. And now having done all this she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>fails not every day to inflict upon me a hundred
lashes with a whip which draws blood at every
stroke: and when these are accomplished she
covers my torn flesh with hair-cloth and lays
over it these rich robes in mockery. Of a
surety it is the will of Heaven that I should be
the most miserable and despised of mortals!"</p>


<hr class="r35" />

</div>
<p class="caption">Began to heap upon me terms of the most

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Thus the youth finished his story, nor when
he had ended could he refrain from tears. The
Sultan also was greatly moved when he heard
it, and his heart became full of a desire to
avenge such injuries upon the doer of them.
"Tell me," he said, "where is now this monster
of iniquity?" "Sir," answered the youth, "I
doubt not she is yonder in the mausoleum
with her companion, for thither she goes daily
so soon as she has measured out to me my
full meed of chastisement: and as for this day
my portion has been served to me, I am quit
of her till to-morrow brings, the hour of fresh
scourgings."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl13"></a><a href="images/lg_pl13.jpg">
<img src="images/pl13.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>

<p class="caption">Thus by her wicked machinations the city
became a lake.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Now when this was told him the Sultan saw
his way plain. "Be of good cheer," he said to
the youth, "and endure with a quiet spirit yet
once more the affliction she causes thee; for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>at the price of that single scourging I trust,
by the will of Heaven, to set thee free."</p>

<p>So on the morrow the Sultan lay in close
hiding until sounds reached him which told
that the whippings had begun; then he arose
and went in haste to the mausoleum, where
amid rich hangings and perfumes and the
illumination of a thousand candles, he found
the black slave stretched mute upon a bed
awaiting in great feebleness the recovered use
of his sawn gullet. Quickly, with a single
sword-stroke, the avenger took from him that
poor remnant of life which enchantment alone
had made possible: then having thrown the
body into a well in the courtyard below, he
lay down in the dead man's place, drawing
the coverlet well over him. Soon after, fresh
from her accustomed task of cruelty, the
enchantress entered, and falling upon her knees
beside the bed she cried, "Has my lord still
no voice wherewith to speak to his servant?
Surely, for lack of that sound, hearing lies
withered within me!" Then the Sultan, taking
to himself the thick speech of a negro, said,
"There is no strength or power but in God
alone!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>On hearing those words, believing that her
companion's speech was at last restored to him,
the queen uttered a cry of joy! But scarcely
had she begun to lavish upon him the tokens
of her affection when the pretended negro broke
out against her in violent abuse. "What!" he
cried, "dost thou expect favour at my hands,
when it is because of thee that for two years I
have lain dumb and prostrate? How darest
thou speak to me or look for any recompense
save death! Nay!" he went on in answer to
her astonished protests, "have not the cries and
tears and groans of thy husband kept me continually
from rest: and has not Heaven smitten
me for no other reason than because thou
wouldst not cease from smiting him? So
has the curse which thou didst seek to lay
upon him fallen doubly upon me."</p>

<p>"Alas!" cried the enchantress, "have I unknowingly
caused thee so great an ill? If it
be so, then let my lord give command, and
whatever be his desire it shall be satisfied."</p>

<p>Then said the Sultan, "Go instantly and
release thy husband from spell and torment: and
when it is done, return hither with all speed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>Thus compelled, in great fear and bewilderment
and sorely against her will, the queen
sped to the chamber in the palace where her
husband lay spell-bound. Taking a vessel of
water she pronounced over it certain words
which caused it instantly to boil as though it
had been set on a fire: then throwing the water
over him, she cried&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Spell be loosed, and stone grow warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Yield back flesh to the human form."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And immediately on the word his nature came
to him again, and he leaped and stood upon
his feet. But the queen's hatred towards
him was by no means abated. "Go hence
quickly," she cried, "since a better will than
mine releases thee! But if thou tarry
or if thou return, thou shalt surely die!"
Thankful for his deliverance the youth stayed
not to question, but departing went and hid
himself without, while the queen returned in
haste to the mausoleum where her supposed
lover awaited her. There, eager for restoration
to favour, she informed him of what she had
done, supposing that to be all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>"Nay," said the other, still speaking with the
thick voice of a negro; "though thou hast lopped
the branch of the evil thou hast not destroyed
the root. For every night I hear a jumping of
fishes in the lake that is between the four hills,
and the sound of their curses on thee and me
comes to disturb my rest. Go instantly and
restore all things to their former state, then
come back and give me thy hand and I shall
rise up a sound man once more."</p>

<p class="caption">Great was the astonishment of the Vizier
and the Sultan's escort.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Rejoicing in that promise and the expectations
it held out to her of future happiness, the
queen went with all speed to the border of the
lake. There taking a little water into her hand,
and uttering strange words over it, she sprinkled
it this way and that upon the surface of the
lake and the roots of the four hills, and immediately
where had been the lake a city appeared,
and instead of fishes inhabitants, and in place
of the four hills four islands. As for the palace
it stood no longer removed far away into the
desert but upon a hill overlooking the city.</p>

<p>Great was the astonishment of the Vizier and
the Sultan's escort which had lain encamped beside
the lake to find themselves suddenly transported
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>to the heart of a populous city, with streets and
walls and the hum of reawakened life around
them; but a greater and more terrible shock
than this awaited the queen upon her return
to the mausoleum to enjoy the reward of her
labours. "Now," she cried, "let my lord arise,
since all that he willed is accomplished!"</p>

<p>"Give me thy hand!" said the Sultan, still
in a voice of disguise; "come nearer that I
may lean on thee!" And as she approached he
drew forth his sword which had lain concealed
beside him in the bed, and with a single blow
cleft her wicked body in twain.</p>

<p>Then he rose and went quickly to where in
hiding lay the young king her husband, who
learned with joy of the death of his cruel enemy.
He thanked the Sultan with tears of gratitude
for his deliverance, and invoked the blessings
of Heaven upon him and his kingdom. "On
yours too," said the Sultan, "let peace and
prosperity now reign! And since your city is
so near to mine, come with me and be my guest
that we may rejoice together in the bonds of
friendship."</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the young king, "that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>would I do willingly, but your country lies many
a day's journey from my own. I fear the breaking
of the spell which held me and my subjects
has brought you further than you wished."</p>

<p>It was in fact true that the Ebony Isles had
now returned to the place from which they had
originally come. The Sultan put a smiling face
upon the matter: "I can well put up with the
tedium of my journey," said he, "if only you
will be my companion. Nay, let me speak
frankly to one whose demeanour in affliction
has won my heart; I am childless and have
no heir. Come with me and be my son, and
when I am dead unite our two kingdoms under
a single ruler." The young king, who had
conceived for his deliverer an equal affection,
could not withstand so noble and generous an
offer: and so with a free exchange of hearts on
both sides the matter was arranged.</p>

<p>After a journey of some months the Sultan
arrived again at his own capital, where he was
welcomed with great rejoicings by the people,
who had long mourned over his strange and
unexplained absence.</p>

<p>As for the old fisherman who had been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>immediate cause of the young king's deliverance
the Sultan loaded him with honours and gave
his daughters in marriage to sons of the blood
royal, so that they all continued in perfect
happiness and contentment to the end of their
days.</p>

<h2>ALI BABA AND THE FORTY THIEVES</h2>

<p class="p2">In a town in Persia lived two brothers named
Cassim and Ali Baba, between whom their father
at his death had left what little property he
possessed equally divided. Cassim, however,
having married the heiress of a rich merchant,
became soon after his marriage the owner of a
fine shop, together with several pieces of land,
and was in consequence, through no effort of his
own, the most considerable merchant in the town.
Ali Baba, on the other hand, was married to one
as poor as himself, and having no other means
of gaining a livelihood he used to go every day
into the forest to cut wood, and lading therewith
the three asses which were his sole stock-in-trade,
would then hawk it about the streets for sale.</p>

<p>One day while he was at work within the
skirts of the forest, Ali Baba saw advancing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>towards him across the open a large company of
horsemen, and fearing from their appearance that
they might be robbers, he left his asses to their
own devices and sought safety for himself in the
lower branches of a large tree which grew in the
close overshadowing of a precipitous rock.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterl">
<a id="pl15"></a><a href="images/lg_pl15.jpg">
<img src="images/pl15.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Their chief in a low but distinct voice
uttered the two words "Open Sesame!"</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Almost immediately it became evident that
this very rock was the goal toward which the
troop was bound, for having arrived they
alighted instantly from their horses, and took
down each man of them a sack which seemed
by its weight and form to be filled with gold.
There could no longer be any doubt that they
were robbers. Ali Baba counted forty of
them.</p>

<p>Just as he had done so, the one nearest to him,
who seemed to be their chief, advanced toward
the rock, and in a low but distinct voice uttered
the two words, "Open, Sesamé!" Immediately
the rock opened like a door, the captain and his
men passed in, and the rock closed behind them.</p>

<p>For a long while Ali Baba waited, not daring
to descend from his hiding-place lest they should
come out and catch him in the act; but at last,
when the waiting had grown almost unbearable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>his patience was rewarded, the door in the rock
opened, and out came the forty men, their captain
leading them. When the last of them was
through, "Shut, Sesamé!" said the captain, and
immediately the face of the rock closed together
as before. Then they all mounted their horses
and rode away.</p>

<p>As soon as he felt sure that they were not
returning, Ali Baba came down from the tree
and made his way at once to that part of the
rock where he had seen the captain and his men
enter. And there at the word "Open, Sesamé!"
a door suddenly revealed itself and opened.</p>

<p>Ali Baba had expected to find a dark and
gloomy cavern. Great was his astonishment
therefore when he perceived a spacious and
vaulted chamber lighted from above through a
fissure in the rock; and there spread out before
him lay treasures in profusion, bales of merchandise,
silks, carpets, brocades, and above all
gold and silver lying in loose heaps or in sacks
piled one upon another. He did not take long
to consider what he should do. Disregarding the
silver and the gold that lay loose, he brought to
the mouth of the cave as many sacks of gold as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>he thought his three asses might carry; and
having loaded them on and covered them with
wood so that they might not be seen, he closed
the rock by the utterance of the magic words
which he had learned, and departed for the
town, a well-satisfied man.</p>

<p>When he got home he drove his asses into a
small court, and shutting the gates carefully he
took off the wood that covered the bags and
carried them in to his wife. She, discovering
them to be full of gold, feared that her husband
had stolen them, and began sorrowfully to
reproach him; but Ali Baba soon put her mind
at rest on that score, and having poured all the
gold into a great heap upon the floor he sat
down at her side to consider how well it
looked.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterl">
<a id="pl16"></a><a href="images/lg_pl16.jpg">
<img src="images/pl16.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Ali Baba departed for the town a well
satisfied man.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Soon his wife, poor careful body, must needs
begin counting it over piece by piece. Ali Baba
let her go on for awhile, but before long the
sight set him laughing. "Wife," said he, "you
will never make an end of it that way. The
best thing to do is to dig a hole and bury it,
then we shall be sure that it is not slipping
through our fingers." "That will do well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>enough," said his wife, "but it would be better
first to have the measure of it. So while you
dig the hole I will go round to Cassim's and
borrow a measure small enough to give us an
exact reckoning." "Do as you will," answered
her husband, "but see that you keep the thing
secret."</p>

<p>Off went Ali Baba's wife to her brother-in-law's
house. Cassim was from home, so she
begged of his wife the loan of a small measure,
naming for choice the smallest. This set the
sister-in-law wondering. Knowing Ali Baba's
poverty she was all the more curious to find out
for what kind of grain so small a measure could
be needed. So before bringing it she covered
all the bottom with lard, and giving it to Ali
Baba's wife told her to be sure and be quick in
returning it. The other, promising to restore it
punctually, made haste to get home; and there
finding the hole dug for its reception she started
to measure the money into it. First she set the
measure upon the heap, then she filled it, then
she carried it to the hole; and so she continued
till the last measure was counted. Then, leaving
Ali Baba to finish the burying, she carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>back the measure with all haste to her sister-in-law,
returning thanks for the loan.</p>

<p>No sooner was her back turned than Cassim's
wife looked at the bottom of the measure, and
there to her astonishment she saw sticking to
the lard a gold coin. "What?" she cried, her
heart filled with envy, "is Ali Baba so rich that
he needs a measure for his gold? Where, then,
I would know, has the miserable wretch obtained
it?"</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl17"></a><a href="images/lg_pl17.jpg">
<img src="images/pl17.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">As soon as he came in she began to jeer at him.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>She waited with impatience for her husband's
return, and as soon as he came in she began to
jeer at him. "You think yourself rich," said
she, "but Ali Baba is richer. You count your
gold by the piece, but Ali Baba does not count,
he measures it! In comparison to Ali Baba we
are but grubs and groundlings!"</p>

<p>Having thus riddled him to the top of her
bent in order to provoke his curiosity, she told
him the story of the borrowed measure, of her
own stratagem, and of its result.</p>

<p>Cassim, instead of being pleased at Ali Baba's
sudden prosperity, grew furiously jealous; not a
wink could he sleep all night for thinking of it.
The next morning before sunrise he went to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>brother's house. "Ali Baba," said he, "what
do you mean by pretending to be poor when all
the time you are scooping up gold by the quart?"
"Brother," said Ali Baba, "explain your meaning."
"My meaning shall be plain!" cried
Cassim, displaying the tell-tale coin. "How
many more pieces have you like this that my
wife found sticking to the bottom of the measure
yesterday?"</p>

<p>Ali Baba, perceiving that the intervention of
wives had made further concealment useless,
told his brother the true facts of the case, and
offered him, as an inducement for keeping the
secret, an equal share of the treasure.</p>

<p>"That is the least that I have the right to
expect," answered Cassim haughtily. "It is
further necessary that you should tell me exactly
where the treasure lies, that I may, if need be,
test the truth of your story, otherwise I shall
find it my duty to denounce you to the
authorities."</p>

<p>Ali Baba, having a clear conscience, had
little fear of Cassim's threats; but out of pure
good nature he gave him all the information he
desired, not forgetting to instruct him in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>words which would give him free passage into
the cave and out again.</p>

<p>Cassim, who had thus secured all he had
come for, lost no time in putting his project
into execution. Intent on possessing himself of
all the treasures which yet remained, he set off
the next morning before daybreak, taking with
him ten mules laden with empty crates. Arrived
before the cave, he recalled the words which
his brother had taught him; no sooner was
"Open, Sesamé!" said than the door in the rock
lay wide for him to pass through, and when he
had entered it shut again.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl18"></a><a href="images/lg_pl18.jpg">
<img src="images/pl18.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Greater still was the exultation of a greedy
nature like that of Cassim's.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>If the simple soul of Ali Baba had found
delight in the riches of the cavern, greater still
was the exultation of a greedy nature like
Cassim's. Intoxicated with the wealth that lay
before his eyes, he had no thought but to gather
together with all speed as much treasure as the ten
mules could carry; and so, having exhausted himself
with heavy labour and avaricious excitement,
he suddenly found on returning to the door
that he had forgotten the key which opened it.
Up and down, and in and out through the
mazes of his brain he chased the missing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>word. Barley, and maize, and rice, he thought
of them all: but of sesamé never once,
because his mind had become dark to the revealing
light of heaven. And so the door stayed
fast, holding him prisoner in the cave, where
to his fate, undeserving of pity, we leave him.</p>

<p>Toward noon the robbers returned, and saw,
standing about the rock, the ten mules laden
with crates. At this they were greatly surprised,
and began to search with suspicion amongst
the surrounding crannies and undergrowth.
Finding no one there, they drew their swords
and advanced cautiously toward the cave, where,
upon the captain's pronouncement of the magic
word, the door immediately fell open. Cassim,
who from within had heard the trampling of
horses, had now no doubt that the robbers were
arrived and that his hour was come. Resolved
however to make one last effort at escape, he
stood ready by the door; and no sooner had the
opening word been uttered than he sprang forth
with such violence that he threw the captain to
the ground. But his attempt was vain; before
he could break through he was mercilessly hacked
down by the swords of the robber band.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>With their fears thus verified, the robbers
anxiously entered the cave to view the traces of
its late visitant. There they saw piled by the door
the treasure which Cassim had sought to carry
away; but while restoring this to its place they
failed altogether to detect the earlier loss which
Ali Baba had caused them. Reckoning, however,
that as one had discovered the secret of
entry others also might know of it, they determined
to leave an example for any who might
venture thither on a similar errand; and having
quartered the body of Cassim they disposed it
at the entrance in a manner most calculated to
strike horror into the heart of the beholder.
Then, closing the door of the cave, they rode
away in the search of fresh exploits and plunder.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Cassim's wife had grown very
uneasy at her husband's prolonged absence; and
at nightfall, unable to endure further suspense,
she ran to Ali Baba, and telling him of his
brother's secret expedition, entreated him to go
out instantly in search of him.</p>

<p>Ali Baba had too kind a heart to refuse or
delay comfort to her affliction. Taking with him
his three asses he set out immediately for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>forest, and as the road was familiar to him he
had soon found his way to the door of the cave.
When he saw there the traces of blood he became
filled with misgiving, but no sooner had he entered
than his worst fears were realized. Nevertheless
brotherly piety gave him courage. Gathering
together the severed remains and wrapping them
about with all possible decency, he laid them
upon one of the asses; then bethinking him that
he deserved some payment for his pains, he
loaded the two remaining asses with sacks of
gold, and covering them with wood as on the
first occasion, made his way back to the town
while it was yet early. Leaving his wife to
dispose of the treasure borne by the two asses, he
led the third to his sister-in-law's house, and
knocking quietly so that none of the neighbours
might hear, was presently admitted by Morgiana,
a female slave whose intelligence and discretion
had long been known to him. "Morgiana,"
said he, "there's trouble on the back of that ass.
Can you keep a secret?" And Morgiana's nod
satisfied him better than any oath. "Well,"
said he, "your master's body lies there waiting
to be pieced, and our business now is to bury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>him honourably as though he had died a natural
death. Go and tell your mistress that I want to
speak to her."</p>

<p>Morgiana went in to her mistress, and returning
presently bade Ali Baba enter. Then,
leaving him to break to his sister-in-law the
news and the sad circumstances of his brother's
death, she, with her plan already formed,
hastened forth and knocked at the door of the
nearest apothecary. As soon as he opened to
her she required of him in trembling agitation
certain pillules efficacious against grave disorders,
declaring in answer to his questions that
her master had been taken suddenly ill. With
these she returned home, and her plan of concealment
having been explained and agreed upon
much to the satisfaction of Ali Baba, she went
forth the next morning to the same apothecary,
and with tears in her eyes besought him to
supply her in haste with a certain drug that is
given to sick people only in the last extremity.
Meanwhile the rumour of Cassim's sickness had
got abroad; Ali Baba and his wife had been seen
coming and going, while Morgiana by her ceaseless
activity had made the two days' pretended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>illness seem like a fortnight: so when a sound
of wailing arose within the house all the neighbours
concluded without further question that
Cassim had died a natural and honourable
death.</p>

<p>But Morgiana had now a still more difficult
task to perform, it being necessary for the obsequies
that the body should be made in some
way presentable. So at a very early hour the next
morning she went to the shop of a certain merry
old cobbler, Baba Mustapha by name, who lived on
the other side of the town. Showing him a piece
of gold she inquired whether he were ready to
earn it by exercising his craft in implicit obedience
to her instructions. And when Baba Mustapha
sought to know the terms, "First," said she, "you
must come with your eyes bandaged; secondly,
you must sew what I put before you without
asking questions; and thirdly, when you return
you must tell nobody."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl19"></a><a href="images/lg_pl19.jpg">
<img src="images/pl19.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Mustapha doubted much of his ability to refrain
from question.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Mustapha, who had a lively curiosity into
other folk's affairs, boggled for a time at the
bandaging, and doubted much of his ability to
refrain from question; but having on these considerations
secured the doubling of his fee, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>promised secrecy readily enough, and taking his
cobbler's tackle in hand submitted himself to
Morgiana's guidance and set forth. This way
and that she led him blindfold, till she had
brought him to the house of her deceased master.
Then uncovering his eyes in the presence of the
dismembered corpse, she bade him get out thread
and wax and join the pieces together.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterl">
<a id="pl20"></a><a href="images/lg_pl20.jpg">
<img src="images/pl20.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">This way and that she led him blindfold.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Baba Mustapha plied his task according to the
compact, asking no question. When he had
done, Morgiana again bandaged his eyes and led
him home, and giving him a third piece of gold
the more to satisfy him, she bade him good-day
and departed.</p>

<p>So in seemliness and without scandal of any
kind were the obsequies of the murdered
Cassim performed. And when all was ended,
seeing that his widow was desolate and his house
in need of a protector, Ali Baba with brotherly
piety took both the one and the other into his
care, marrying his sister-in-law according to
Moslem rule, and removing with all his goods and
newly acquired treasure to the house which had
been his brother's. And having also acquired
the shop where Cassim had done business, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>put into it his own son, who had already served
an apprenticeship to the trade. So, with his
fortune well established, let us now leave Ali
Baba and return to the robbers'cave.</p>

<p>Thither, at the appointed time, came the forty
robbers, bearing in hand fresh booty; and great
was their consternation to discover that not only
had the body of Cassim been removed, but a
good many sacks of gold as well. It was no
wonder that this should trouble them, for so
long as any one could command secret access, the
cave was useless as a depository for their wealth.
The question was, What could they do to put an
end to their present insecurity? After long debate
it was agreed that one of their number should go
into the town disguised as a traveller, and there,
mixing with the common people, learn from their
report whether there had been recently any case
in their midst of sudden prosperity or sudden
death. If such a thing could be discovered, then
they made sure of tracking the evil to its source
and imposing a remedy.</p>

<p>Although the penalty for failure was death, one
of the robbers at once boldly offered himself for
the venture, and having transformed himself by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>disguise and received the wise counsels and commendations
of his fellows, he set out for the town.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl21"></a><a href="images/lg_pl21.jpg">
<img src="images/pl21.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Having transformed himself by disguise.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Arriving at dawn he began to walk up and down
the streets and watch the early stirring of the inhabitants.
So, before long, he drew up at the
door of Baba Mustapha, who, though old, was
already seated at work upon his cobbler's bench.
The robber accosted him. "I wonder," said he,
"to see a man of your age at work so early. Does
not so dull a light strain your eyes?" "Not so
much as you might think," answered Baba Mustapha.
"Why, it was but the other day that at this
same hour I saw well enough to stitch up a dead
body in a place where it was certainly no lighter."
"Stitch up a dead body!" cried the robber,
in pretended amazement, concealing his joy at
this sudden intelligence. "Surely you mean in its
winding sheet, for how else can a dead body be
stitched?" "No, no," said Mustapha; "what I
say I mean; but as it is a secret, I can tell you
no more." The robber drew out a piece of gold.
"Come," said he, "tell me nothing you do not
care to; only show me the house where lay the
body that you stitched." Baba Mustapha eyed
the gold longingly. "Would that I could," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>replied; "but alas! I went to it blindfold."
"Well," said the robber, "I have heard that a
blind man remembers his road; perhaps, though
seeing you might lose it, blindfold you might
find it again." Tempted by the offer of a second
piece of gold, Baba Mustapha was soon persuaded
to make the attempt. "It was here that
I started," said he, showing the spot, "and I
turned as you see me now." The robber then
put a bandage over his eyes, and walked beside
him through the streets, partly guiding and partly
being led, till of his own accord Baba Mustapha
stopped. "It was here," said he. "The door
by which I went in should now lie to the right."
And he had in fact come exactly opposite to the
house which had once been Cassim's, where Ali
Baba now dwelt.</p>

<p>The robber, having marked the door with a
piece of chalk which he had provided for the
purpose, removed the bandage from Mustapha's
eyes, and leaving him to his own devices returned
with all possible speed to the cave where his
comrades were awaiting him.</p>

<p>Soon after the robber and cobbler had parted,
Morgiana happened to go out upon an errand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>and as she returned she noticed the mark upon
the door. "This," she thought, "is not as it
should be; either some trick is intended, or there
is evil brewing for my masters house." Taking
a piece of chalk she put a similar mark upon the
five or six doors lying to right and left; and
having done this she went home with her mind
satisfied, saying nothing.</p>

<p>In the meantime the robbers had learned from
their companion the success of his venture.
Greatly elated at the thought of the vengeance
so soon to be theirs, they formed a plan for
entering the city in a manner that should arouse
no suspicion among the inhabitants. Passing in
by twos and threes, and by different routes, they
came together to the market-place at an appointed
time, while the captain and the robber who had
acted as spy made their way alone to the street
in which the marked door was to be found.
Presently, just as they had expected, they perceived
a door with the mark on it. "That is it!"
said the robber; but as they continued walking
so as to avoid suspicion, they came upon another
and another, till, before they were done, they had
passed six in succession. So alike were the marks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>that the spy, though he swore he had made but
one, could not tell which it was. Seeing that the
design had failed, the captain returned to the
market-place, and having passed the word for
his troop to go back in the same way as they
had come, he himself set the example of retreat.</p>

<p>When they were all reassembled in the forest,
the captain explained how the matter had fallen,
and the spy, acquiescing in his own condemnation,
kneeled down and received the stroke of the
executioner.</p>

<p>But as it was still necessary for the safety of
all that so great a trespass and theft should not
pass unavenged, another of the band, undeterred
by the fate of his comrade, volunteered upon the
same conditions to prosecute the quest wherein
the other had failed. Coming by the same
means to the house of Ali Baba, he set upon the
door, at a spot not likely to be noticed, a mark in
red chalk to distinguish it clearly from those
which were already marked in white. But even
this precaution failed of its end. Morgiana,
whose eye nothing could escape, noticed the red
mark at the first time of passing, and dealt with
it just as she had done with the previous one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>So when the robbers came, hoping this time to
light upon the door without fail, they found not
one but six all similarly marked with red.</p>

<p>When the second spy had received the due
reward of his blunder, the captain considered
how by trusting to others he had come to lose
two of his bravest followers, so the third attempt
he determined to conduct in person. Having
found his way to Ali Baba's door, as the two
others had done by the aid of Baba Mustapha,
he did not set any mark upon it, but examined it
so carefully that he could not in future mistake
it. He then returned to the forest and communicated
to his band the plan which he had
formed. This was to go into the town in the
disguise of an oil-merchant, bearing with him
upon nineteen mules thirty-eight large leather
jars, one of which, as a sample, was to be full
of oil, but all the others empty. In these he
purposed to conceal the thirty-seven robbers to
which his band was now reduced, and so to
convey his full force to the scene of action in
such a manner as to arouse no suspicion till the
signal for vengeance should be given.</p>

<p>Within a couple of days he had secured all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>the mules and jars that were requisite, and
having disposed of his troop according to the
pre-arranged plan, he drove his train of well-laden
mules to the gates of the city, through
which he passed just before sunset. Proceeding
thence to Ali Baba's house, and arriving as it
fell dark, he was about to knock and crave a
lodging for the night, when he perceived Ali
Baba at the door enjoying the fresh air after
supper. Addressing him in tones of respect,
"Sir," said he, "I have brought my oil a great
distance to sell to-morrow in the market; and
at this late hour, being a stranger, I know not
where to seek for a shelter. If it is not troubling
you too much, allow me to stable my beasts
here for the night."</p>

a great distance to sell to-morrow."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The captain's voice was now so changed from
its accustomed tone of command, that Ali Baba,
though he had heard it before, did not recognize
it. Not only did he grant the stranger's request
for bare accommodation, but as soon as the
unlading and stabling of the mules had been
accomplished, he invited him to stay no longer
in the outer court but enter the house as his
guest. The captain, whose plans this proposal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>somewhat disarranged, endeavoured to excuse
himself from a pretended reluctance to give
trouble; but since Ali Baba would take no
refusal he was forced at last to yield, and to
submit with apparent complaisance to an entertainment
which the hospitality of his host
extended to a late hour.</p>

<p>When they were about to retire for the night,
Ali Baba went into the kitchen to speak to
Morgiana; and the captain of the robbers, on
the pretext of going to look after his mules,
slipped out into the yard where the oil jars
were standing in line. Passing from jar to jar
he whispered into each, "When you hear a
handful of pebbles fall from the window of the
chamber where I am lodged, then cut your way
out of the jar and make ready, for the time
will have come." He then returned to the house,
where Morgiana came with a light and conducted
him to his chamber.</p>

<p>Now Ali Baba, before going to bed, had said
to Morgiana, "To-morrow at dawn I am going
to the baths; let my bathing-linen be put ready,
and see that the cook has some good broth
prepared for me against my return." Having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>therefore led the guest up to his chamber,
Morgiana returned to the kitchen and ordered
Abdallah the cook to put on the pot for the
broth. Suddenly while she was skimming it,
the lamp went out, and, on searching, she found
there was no more oil in the house. At so late
an hour no shop would be open, yet somehow
the broth had to be made, and that could not
be done without a light. "As for that," said
Abdallah, seeing her perplexity, "why trouble
yourself? There is plenty of oil out in the
yard." "Why, to be sure!" said Morgiana,
and sending Abdallah to bed so that he might
be up in time to wake his master on the morrow,
she took the oil-can herself and went out into
the court. As she approached the jar which
stood nearest, she heard a voice within say, "Is
it time?"</p>

<p>To one of Morgiana's intelligence an oil-jar
that spoke was an object of even more suspicion
than a chalk-mark on a door, and in an
instant she apprehended what danger for her
master and his family might lie concealed around
her. Understanding well enough that an oil-jar
which asked a question required an answer, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>replied quick as thought and without the least
sign of perturbation, "Not yet, but presently."
And thus she passed from jar to jar, thirty-seven
in all, giving the same answer, till she
came to the one which contained the oil.</p>

<p>The situation was now clear to her. Aware of
the source from which her master had acquired
his wealth, she guessed at once that, in extending
shelter to the oil-merchant, Ali Baba had in fact
admitted to his house the robber captain and his
band. On the instant her resolution was formed.
Having filled the oil-can she returned to the
kitchen; there she lighted the lamp, and then,
taking a large kettle, went back once more to
the jar which contained the oil. Filling the
kettle she carried it back to the kitchen, and
putting under it a great fire of wood had soon
brought it to the boil. Then taking it in hand
once more, she went out into the yard and
poured into each jar in turn a sufficient quantity
of the boiling oil to scald its occupant to death.</p>

<p>She then returned to the kitchen, and having
made Ali Baba's broth, put out the fire, blew out
the lamp, and sat down by the window to watch.</p>

</div>

<p class="caption">She poured into each jar in turn a sufficient

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Before long the captain of the robbers awoke
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>from the short sleep which he had allowed himself,
and finding that all was silent in the house,
he rose softly and opened the window. Below
stood the oil-jars; gently into their midst he
threw the handful of pebbles agreed on as a
signal; but from the oil-jars came no answer.
He threw a second and a third time; yet though
he could hear the pebbles falling among the jars,
there followed only the silence of the dead.
Wondering whether his band had fled leaving
him in the lurch, or whether they were all asleep,
he grew uneasy, and descending in haste, made
his way into the court. As he approached the
first jar a smell of burning and hot oil assailed
his nostrils, and looking within he beheld in
rigid contortion the dead body of his comrade.
In every jar the same sight presented itself till
he came to the one which had contained the oil.
There, in what was missing, the means and
manner of his companions' death were made
clear to him. Aghast at the discovery and
awake to the danger that now threatened him,
he did not delay an instant, but forcing the
garden-gate, and thence climbing from wall to
wall, he made his escape out of the city.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>When Morgiana, who had remained all this
time on the watch, was assured of his final
departure, she put her master's bath-linen ready,
and went to bed well satisfied with her day's work.</p>

<p>The next morning Ali Baba, awakened by his
slave, went to the baths before daybreak. On
his return he was greatly surprised to find that
the merchant was gone, leaving his mules and
oil-jars behind him. He inquired of Morgiana
the reason. "You will find the reason," said
she, "if you look into the first jar you come to."
Ali Baba did so, and, seeing a man, started back
with a cry. "Do not be afraid," said Morgiana,
"he is dead and harmless; and so are all the
others whom you will find if you look further."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl24"></a><a href="images/lg_pl24.jpg">
<img src="images/pl24.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">When Morgiana who had remained all
this time on the watch.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>As Ali Baba went from one jar to another,
finding always the same sight of horror within,
his knees trembled under him; and when he
came at last to the one empty oil-jar, he stood
for a time motionless, turning upon Morgiana
eyes of wonder and inquiry. "And what," he
said then, "has become of the merchant?"
"To tell you that," said Morgiana, "will be to
tell you the whole story; you will be better able
to hear it if you have your broth first."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>But the curiosity of Ali Baba was far too
great: he would not be kept waiting. So without
further delay she gave him the whole
history, so far as she knew it, from beginning
to end; and by her intelligent putting of one
thing against another, she left him at last in no
possible doubt as to the source and nature of
the conspiracy which her quick wits had so
happily defeated. "And now, dear master," she
said in conclusion, "continue to be on your
guard, for though all these are dead, one remains
alive; and he, if I mistake not, is the captain
of the band, and for that reason the more
formidable and the more likely to cherish the
hope of vengeance."</p>

<p>When Morgiana had done speaking Ali Baba
clearly perceived that he owed to her not merely
the protection of his property but life itself.
His heart was full of gratitude. "Do not
doubt," he said, "that before I die I will reward
you as you deserve; and as an immediate proof
from this moment I give you your liberty."</p>

<p>This token of his approval filled Morgiana's
heart with delight, but she had no intention of
leaving so kind a master, even had she been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>sure that all danger was now over. The
immediate question which next presented itself
was how to dispose of the bodies. Luckily at
the far end of the garden stood a thick grove of
trees, and under these Ali Baba was able to dig
a large trench without attracting the notice of
his neighbours. Here the remains of the thirty-seven
robbers were laid side by side, the trench
was filled again, and the ground made level.
As for the mules, since Ali Baba had no use for
them, he sent them, one or two at a time, to the
market to be sold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the robber captain had fled back to
the forest. Entering the cave he was overcome
by its gloom and loneliness. "Alas!" he cried,
"my comrades, partners in my adventures,
sharers of my fortune, how shall I endure to
live without you? Why did I lead you to a
fate where valour was of no avail, and where
death turned you into objects of ridicule?
Surely had you died sword in hand my sorrow
had been less bitter! And now what remains for
me but to take vengeance for your death and to
prove, by achieving it without aid, that I was
worthy to be the captain of such a band!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>Thus resolved, at an early hour the next day,
he assumed a disguise suitable to his purpose,
and going to the town took lodging in a khan.
Entering into conversation with his host he
inquired whether anything of interest had
happened recently in the town; but the other,
though full of gossip, had nothing to tell him
concerning the matter in which he was most
interested, for Ali Baba, having to conceal from
all the source of his wealth, had also to be silent
as to the dangers in which it involved him.</p>

<p>The captain then inquired where there was a
shop for hire; and hearing of one that suited
him, he came to terms with the owner, and before
long had furnished it with all kinds of rich stuffs
and carpets and jewelry which he brought by
degrees with great secrecy from the cave.</p>

<p>Now this shop happened to be opposite to that
which had belonged to Cassim and was now
occupied by the son of Ali Baba; so before long
the son and the new-comer, who had assumed
the name of Cogia Houssain, became acquainted;
and as the youth had good looks, kind manners,
and a sociable disposition, it was not long before
the acquaintance became intimate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>Cogia Houssain did all he could to seal the
pretended friendship, the more so as it had not
taken him long to discover how the young man
and Ali Baba were related; so, plying him
constantly with small presents and acts of
hospitality, he forced on him the obligation of
making some return.</p>

<p>Ali Baba's son, however, had not at his lodging
sufficient accommodation for entertainment; he
therefore told his father of the difficulty in which
Cogia Houssain's favours had placed him, and
Ali Baba with great willingness at once offered
to arrange matters. "My son," said he, "to-morrow
being a holiday, all shops will be closed;
then do you after dinner invite Cogia Houssain to
walk with you; and as you return bring him this
way and beg him to come in. That will be better
than a formal invitation, and Morgiana shall
have a supper prepared for you."</p>

<p>This proposal was exactly what Ali Baba's son
could have wished, so on the morrow he brought
Cogia Houssain to the door as if by accident, and
stopping, invited him to enter.</p>

<p>Cogia Houssain, who saw his object thus
suddenly attained, began by showing pretended
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>reluctance, but Ali Baba himself coming to the
door, pressed him in the most kindly manner to
enter, and before long had conducted him to the
table, where food stood prepared.</p>

<p>But there an unlooked-for difficulty arose.
Wicked though he might be the robber captain
was not so impious as to eat the salt of the man
he intended to kill. He therefore began with
many apologies to excuse himself; and when
Ali Baba sought to know the reason, "Sir," said
he, "I am sure that if you knew the cause of my
resolution you would approve of it. Suffice it to
say that I have made it a rule to eat of no dish
that has salt in it. How then can I sit down at
your table if I must reject everything that is set
before me?"</p>

<p>"If that is your scruple," said Ali Baba, "it
shall soon be satisfied," and he sent orders to the
kitchen that no salt was to be put into any of the
dishes presently to be served to the newly arrived
guest. "Thus," said he to Cogia Houssain, "I
shall still have the honour, to which I have looked
forward, of returning to you under my own roof
the hospitality you have shown to my son."
Morgiana, who was just about to serve supper,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>received the order with some discontent. "Who,"
she said, "is this difficult person that refuses to
eat salt? He must be a curiosity worth looking
at." So when the saltless courses were ready to
be set upon the table, she herself helped to carry
in the dishes. No sooner had she set eyes on
Cogia Houssain than she recognized him in spite
of his disguise; and observing his movements
with great attention she saw that he had a dagger
concealed beneath his robe. "Ah!" she said to
herself, "here is reason enough! For who will
eat salt with the man he means to murder?
But he shall not murder my master if I can
prevent it."</p>

<p>Now Morgiana knew that the most favourable
opportunity for the robber captain to carry out his
design would be after the courses had been withdrawn,
and when Ali Baba and his son and
guest were alone together over their wine, which
indeed was the very project that Cogia Houssain
had formed. Going forth, therefore, in haste, she
dressed herself as a dancer, assuming the headdress
and mask suitable for the character. Then
she fastened a silver girdle about her waist, and
hung upon it a dagger of the same material.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Thus equipped, she said to Abdallah the cook,
"Take your tabor and let us go in and give an
entertainment in honour of our master's guest."</p>

<p>So Abdallah took his tabor, and played Morgiana
into the hall. As soon as she had entered
she made a low curtsey, and stood awaiting
orders. Then Ali Baba, seeing that she wished
to perform in his guest's honour, said kindly,
"Come in, Morgiana, and show Cogia Houssain
what you can do."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl25"></a><a href="images/lg_pl25.jpg">
<img src="images/pl25.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Then for the last figure of all she drew
out the dagger.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Immediately Abdallah began to beat upon his
tabor and sing an air for Morgiana to dance to;
and she, advancing with much grace and propriety
of deportment, began to move through several
figures, performing them with the ease and
facility which none but the most highly practised
can attain to. Then, for the last figure of all, she
drew out the dagger and, holding it in her hand,
danced a dance which excelled all that had preceded
it in the surprise and change and quickness
and dexterity of its movements. Now she presented
the dagger at her own breast, now at one
of the onlookers; but always in the act of striking
she drew back. At length, as though out of
breath, she snatched his instrument from Abdallah
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>with her left hand, and, still holding the dagger
in her right, advanced the hollow of the tabor
toward her master, as is the custom of dancers
when claiming their fee. Ali Baba threw in a
piece of gold; his son did likewise. Then
advancing it in the same manner toward Cogia
Houssain, who was feeling for his purse, she
struck under it, and before he knew had plunged
her dagger deep into his heart.</p>

<p>Ali Baba and his son, seeing their guest fall dead,
cried out in horror at the deed. "Wretch!"
exclaimed Ali Baba, "what ruin and shame hast
thou brought on us?" "Nay," answered
Morgiana, "it is not your ruin but your life
that I have thus secured; look and convince
yourself what man was this which refused to
eat salt with you!" So saying, she tore off the
dead robbers disguise, showing the dagger concealed
below, and the face which her master now
for the first time recognized.</p>

<p>Ali Baba's gratitude to Morgiana for thus
preserving his life a second time, knew no bounds.
He took her in his arms and embraced her as a
daughter. "Now," said he, "the time is come
when I must fulfil my debt; and how better can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>I do it than by marrying you to my son?"
This proposition, far from proving unwelcome to
the young man, did but confirm an inclination
already formed. A few days later the nuptials
were celebrated with great joy and solemnity, and
the union thus auspiciously commenced was
productive of as much happiness as lies within
the power of mortals to secure.</p>

<p>As for the robbers'cave, it remained the secret
possession of Ali Baba and his posterity; and
using their good fortune with equity and moderation,
they rose to high office in the city and were
held in great honour by all who knew them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE MAGIC HORSE</h2>

<p class="p2">In the land of the Persians there lived in
ancient times a King who had three daughters
and an only son of such beauty that they drew the
eyes of all beholders like moonrise in a clear
heaven. Now it was the custom in that country
for a great festival to be held at the new year,
during which people of all grades, from the
highest to the lowest, presented themselves before
the King with offerings and salutations. So it
happened that on one of these days there came to
the King as he sat in state three sages, masters
of their craft, bringing gifts for approval.
The first had with him a peacock of gold which
was so constructed that at the passing of each
hour it beat its wings and uttered a cry. And the
King, having proved it, found the gift acceptable
and caused the inventor thereof to be suitably
rewarded. The second had made a trumpet so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>if placed over the gates of a city it blew a blast
against any that sought to enter; and thus was the
city held safe from surprise by an enemy. And
when the King had found that it possessed that
property, he accepted it, bestowing on its maker
a rich reward.</p>

<p>But the gift of the third sage, who was an
Indian, appeared more prodigious than all, for
he had brought with him a horse of ivory and
ebony, for which he claimed that, at the will of
its owner, or of any one instructed in the secret,
it would rise above the earth and fly, arriving at
distant places in a marvellously short space of
time. The King, full of wonder at such a statement,
and eager to test it, was in some doubt as
to how he might do so, for the Indian was unwilling
to part with the secret until secure of the
reward which in his own mind he had fixed on.
Now it happened that at a distance of some three
leagues from the city there stood a mountain the
top of which was clearly discernible to all eyes;
so, in order that the Indian's word might be
proved, the King, pointing to it, said, "Go
yonder, and bring back to me while I wait the
branch of a palm-tree which grows at the foot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>of that mountain; then I shall know that what
you tell me is true."</p>

<p>Instantly the Indian set foot in the stirrup
and vaulted upon his charger, and scarcely had
he turned a small peg which was set in the
pommel of the saddle, when the horse rose lightly
into the air and bore him away at wondrous
speed amid the shouts of the beholders; and
while all were still gazing, amazed at so sudden
a vanishing, he reappeared high overhead, bearing
the palm branch, and descending into their
midst alighted upon the very spot from which
he had started, where, prostrating himself, he laid
the branch at the King's feet.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl26"></a><a href="images/lg_pl26.jpg">
<img src="images/pl26.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">At so arrogant a claim all the courtiers
burst into loud laughter.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The King was so delighted when the wonderful
properties of the horse had been thus revealed
to him, that, eager to possess it, he bade the
Indian name his own reward, declaring that no
price could be too great. Then said the sage,
"Since your Majesty so truly appreciates the value
of my invention, I do not fear that the reward
I ask for will seem too high. Give me in
marriage the hand of the fairest of your three
daughters, and the horse shall be yours."</p>

<p>At so arrogant a claim all the courtiers burst
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>into loud laughter; the King alone, consumed
with the desire of possessing the wonderful
treasure, hesitated as to what answer he should
give. Then the King's son, Prince Firouz
Schah, seeing his father lend ear to so shameful
a proposal, became moved with indignation.
Determined to defend his sister's honour and
his own, he addressed the King. "Pardon me,
Sire," said he, "if I take the liberty of speaking.
But how shall it be possible for one of the
greatest and most powerful monarchs to ally
himself to a mere nobody? I entreat you to
consider what is due not to yourself alone but
to the high blood of your ancestors and of your
children."</p>

<p>"My son," replied the King of Persia, "what
you say is very true, so far as it goes; but
you do not sufficiently consider the value of
so incomparable a marvel as this horse has
proved itself to be, or how great would be my
chagrin if any other monarch came to possess
it. And though I have not yet agreed to the
Indian's proposal, I cannot incontinently reject
it. But first I must be satisfied that the horse
will obey other hands besides those of its inventor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>else, though I become its possessor, I
may find it useless."</p>

<p>The Indian, who had stood aside during this discussion,
was now full of hope, for he perceived that
the King had not altogether rejected his terms,
and nothing seemed likelier than that the more
he became familiar with the properties of the
magic horse the more would he wish to possess
it. When, therefore, the King proposed that
the horse should be put to a more independent
trial under another rider, the Indian readily
agreed; the more so when the prince himself,
relinquishing his apparent opposition, came forward
and volunteered for the essay.</p>

<p>The King having consented, the prince
mounted, and eager in his design to give his
father opportunity for cooler reflection, he did not
wait to hear all the Indian's instructions, but
turning the peg, as he had seen the other do when
first mounting, caused the horse to rise suddenly
in the air, and was carried away out of sight
in an easterly direction more swiftly than an
arrow shot from a bow.</p>

<p>No sooner had the horse and its rider disappeared
than the King became greatly concerned for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>his son's safety; and though the sage could justly
excuse himself on the ground that the young
prince's impatience had caused him to cut short
the instructions which would have insured his safe
return, the King choose to vent upon the Indian
the full weight of his displeasure; and cursing
the day wherein he had first set eyes on the
magic horse, he caused its maker to be thrown
into prison, declaring that if the prince did not
return within a stated time the life of the other
should be forfeit.</p>

<p>The Indian had now good cause to repent of
the ambition which had brought him to this
extremity, for the prince, of whose opposition to
his project he had been thoroughly informed, had
only to prolong his absence to involve him in
irretrievable ruin. But on the failure of arrogant
pretensions the sympathy of the judicious is
wasted; let us return therefore to Prince Firouz
Schah, whom we left flying through the air with
incredible swiftness on the back of the magic
steed.</p>

<p>For a time, confident of his skill as a
rider and undismayed either by the speed or
altitude of his flight, the prince had no wish to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>return to the palace; but presently the thought of
his father's anxiety occurred to him, and being of a
tender and considerate disposition he immediately
endeavoured to divert his steed from its forward
course. This he sought to do by turning in the
contrary direction the peg which he had handled
when mounting, but to his astonishment the
horse responded by rising still higher in the air
and flying forward with redoubled swiftness.
Had courage then deserted him, his situation
might have become perilous; but preserving his
accustomed coolness he began carefully to search
for the means by which the speed of the machine
might be abated, and before long he perceived
under the horse's mane a smaller peg, which he
had no sooner touched than he felt himself descending
rapidly toward the earth, with a speed
that lessened the nearer he came to ground.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>As he descended, the daylight in which
hitherto he had been travelling faded from view,
and he passed within a few minutes from sunset
into an obscurity so dense that he could no
longer distinguish the nature of his environment,
till, as the horse alighted, he perceived beneath
him a smooth expanse ending abruptly on all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>sides at an apparent elevation among the objects
surrounding it.</p>

<p>Dismounting he found himself on the roof of
a large palace, with marble balustrades dividing
it in terraces, and at one side a staircase which
led down to the interior. With a spirit ever
ready for adventure Prince Firouz Schah immediately
descended, groping his way through the
darkness till he came to a landing on the further
side of which an open door led into a room where
a dim light was burning.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl28"></a><a href="images/lg_pl28.jpg">
<img src="images/pl28.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">He saw black eunuchs lying asleep.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The prince paused at the doorway to listen,
but all he could hear was the sound of men
breathing heavily in their sleep. He pushed the
door and entered; and there across an inner
threshold he saw black eunuchs lying asleep, each
with a drawn sword in his hand. Immediately
he guessed that something far more fair must
lie beyond; so, undeterred by the danger, he
advanced, and stepping lightly across their
swords passed through silken hangings into the
inner chamber. Here he perceived, amid surroundings
of regal magnificence, a number of
couches, one of which stood higher than the rest.
Upon each of these a fair damsel lay asleep;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>but upon that which was raised above its fellows
lay a form of such perfect and enchanting beauty
that the prince had no will or power to turn
away after once beholding it. Approaching the
sleeper softly, he kneeled down and plucked her
gently by the sleeve; and immediately the
princess&mdash;for such if rank and beauty accorded
she needs must be&mdash;opened to him the depths
of her lustrous eyes and gazed in quiet amazement
at the princely youth whose handsome
looks and reverent demeanour banished at once
all thought of alarm.</p>

<p>Now it so happened that a son of the King of
India was at that time seeking the hand of the
princess in marriage; but her father, the King
of Bengal, had rejected him owing to his
ferocious and disagreeable aspect. When therefore
the princess saw one of royal appearance
kneeling before her she supposed he could be
no other than the suitor whom she knew only
by report, and shedding upon him the light of
her regard, "By Allah," she said, smiling, "my
father lied in saying that good looks were lacking
to thee!"</p>

<p>Prince Firouz Schah, perceiving from these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>words and the glance which accompanied them,
that her disposition towards him was favourable,
no longer feared to acquaint her with the plight
in which he found himself; while the princess,
for her part, listened to the story of his adventures
with lively interest, and learned, not
without secret satisfaction, that her visitor possessed
a rank and dignity equal to her own.</p>

<p class="caption">She gave orders for a rich banquet to be

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Meanwhile the maidens who were in attendance
on the princess had awakened in dismay to the
unaccountable apparition of a fair youth kneeling
at the feet of their mistress, and, dreading
discovery by the attendants, were all at a loss
what to do. The princess however, seeing that
they were awake, called them to her with perfect
composure and bade them go instantly and
prepare an inner chamber where the prince
might sleep and recover from the fatigues of his
journey; at the same time she gave orders for
a rich banquet to be prepared against the time
when he should be ready to partake of it. Then
when her visitor had retired, she arose and
began to adorn herself in jewels and rich robes
and to anoint her body with fragrance, giving
her women no rest till the tale of her mirror
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>contented her; and when all had been done
many times over, and the last touch of art added
to her loveliness, she sent to inquire whether the
prince had yet awaked and were ready to receive
her.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl30"></a><a href="images/lg_pl30.jpg">
<img src="images/pl30.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Till the tale of her mirror contented her.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Upon the receipt of that message the prince
rose eagerly, and dressing in haste, although it
was scarcely yet day, heard everywhere within
the palace sounds of preparation for the feast
that was being got ready in his honour.</p>

<p>Before long the princess herself entered to
inquire how he had slept, and being fully assured
on that score, she gave orders for the banquet
to be served. Everything was done in the
greatest magnificence, but the princess was full
of apologies, declaring the entertainment unworthy
of so distinguished a guest. "You
must pardon me, prince," she said, "for receiving
you with so little state, and after so hasty a
preparation; but the chief of the eunuchs does
not enter here without my express permission,
and I feared that elsewhere our conversation
might be interrupted."</p>

<p>Prince Firouz Schah was now convinced that
the inclinations of the princess corresponded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>with his own; but though her every word and
movement increased the tenderness of his
passion, he did not forget the respect due to her
rank and virtue. One of her women attendants
however, seeing clearly in what direction matters
were tending, and fearing for herself the results
of a sudden discovery, withdrew secretly, saying
nothing to the rest, and running quickly to the
chief of the eunuchs she cried, "O miserable
man, what sorry watch is this that thou hast
kept, guarding the King's honour; and who is
this man or genie that thou hast admitted to the
presence of our mistress? Nay, if the matter be
not already past remedy the fault is not thine!"
At these words the eunuch leapt up in alarm,
and going secretly he lifted the curtain of the
inner chamber, and there beheld at the princess's
side a youth of such fair and majestical appearance
that he durst not intrude unbidden. He
ran shrieking to the King, and as he went he
rent his garments and threw dust upon his head.
"O sire and master," he cried, "come quickly
and save thy daughter, for there is with her a
genie in mortal form and like a king's son to
look upon, and if he have not already carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>her away, make haste and give orders that he
be seized, lest thou become childless."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl31"></a><a href="images/lg_pl31.jpg">
<img src="images/pl31.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">She cried: "O miserable man what sorry
watch is this that thou hast kept".</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The King at once arose and went in great
haste and fear to his daughters palace. There
he was met by certain of her women, who, seeing
his alarm, said, "O sire, have no fear for the
safety of thy daughter; for this young man is
as handsome of heart as of person, and as his
conduct is chaste, so also are his intentions
honourable."</p>

<p>Then the King's wrath was cooled somewhat;
but since much remained which demanded
explanation he drew his sword and advanced
with a threatening aspect into the room where
his daughter and the prince still sat conversing.
Prince Firouz Schah observing the new-comer
advance upon him in a warlike attitude, drew
his own sword and stood ready for defence;
whereupon the King, seeing that the other was
the stronger, sheathed his weapon, and with a
gesture of salutation addressed him courteously.
"Tell me, fair youth," he said, "whether you are
man or devil, for though in appearance you are
human, how else than by devilry have you come
here?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>"Sire," replied the youth, "but for the respect
that is owing to the father of so fair a daughter,
I, whom am a son of kings, might resent such
an imputation. Be assured, however, that by
whatever means I have chosen to arrive, my
intentions now are altogether human and
honourable; for I have no other or dearer
wish than to become your son-in-law through
my marriage with this princess in whose eyes it
is my happiness to have found favour."</p>

<p>"What you tell me," answered the King,
"may be all very true; but it is not the custom
for the sons of kings to enter into palaces without
the permission of their owners, coming, moreover,
unannounced and with no retinue or mark of
royalty about them. How, then, shall I convince
my people that you are a fit suitor for the hand
of my daughter?"</p>

<p>"The proof of honour and kingship," answered
the other, "does not rest in splendour and retinue
alone, though these also would be at my call had
I the patience to await their arrival from that
too distant country where my father is king.
Let it suffice if I shall be able to prove my
worth alone and unaided, in such a manner as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>satisfy all." "Alone and unaided?" said the
King; "how may that be?" "I will prove it
thus," answered the prince. "Call out your
troops and let them surround this palace;
tell them that you have here a stranger, of
whom nothing is known, who declares that
if you will not yield him the hand of your
daughter in marriage he will carry her away
from you by force. Bid them use all means
to capture and slay me, and if I survive so
unequal a contest, judge then whether or no I
am fit to become your son-in-law."</p>

<p>The King immediately accepted the proposal,
agreeing to abide by the result; yet was he
grieved that a youth of such fair looks and
promise should throw away his life in so foolhardy
an adventure. As soon as day dawned
he sent for his Vizier and bade him cause all the
chiefs of his army to assemble with their troops
and companies, till presently there were gathered
about the palace forty thousand horsemen and
the same number of foot; and the King gave
them instructions, saying, "When the young
man of whom I have warned you comes forth
and challenges you to battle, then fall upon and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>slay him, for in no wise must he escape." He
then led the prince to an open space whence he
could see the whole army drawn up in array
against him. "Yonder," said the King, pointing,
"are those with whom you have to contend; go
forth and deal with them as seems best to you."</p>

<p>"Nay," answered the prince, "these are not
fair conditions, for yonder I see horsemen as
well as foot; how shall I contend against these
unless I be mounted?" The King at once offered
him the best horse in his stables, but the prince
would not hear of it. "Is it fair," he said, "that
I should trust my life under such conditions to
a horse that I have never ridden? I will ride
no horse but that upon which I came hither."
"Where is that?" inquired the King. "If
it be where I left it," answered the prince, "it is
upon the roof of the palace."</p>

<p>All who heard this answer were filled with
laughter and astonishment, for it seemed impossible
that a horse could have climbed to so high
a roof. Nevertheless the King commanded that
search should be made, and there, sure enough,
those that were sent found the horse of ebony
and ivory standing stiff and motionless. So
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>though it still seemed to them but a thing for
jest and mockery, obeying the King's orders they
raised it upon their shoulders, and bearing it to
earth carried it forth into the open space before
the palace where the King's troops were
assembled.</p>

<p>Then Prince Firouz Schah advanced, and
leaping upon the horse he cried defiance to the
eighty thousand men that stood in battle array
against him. And they, on their part, seeing
the youth so hardily set on his own destruction,
drew sword and couched spear, and came all
together to the charge. The prince waited till
they were almost upon him, then turning the peg
which stood in the pommel of his saddle he
caused the horse to rise suddenly in the air, and
all the foremost ranks of the enemy came clashing
together beneath him. At that sight the
King and all his court drew a breath of astonishment,
and the army staggered and swung about
this way and that, striking vainly up at the
hoofs of the magic horse as it flew over them.
Then the King, full of dread lest this should
indeed be some evil genie that sought to carry
his daughter away from him, called to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>archers to shoot, but before they could make
ready their bows Prince Firouz Schah had given
another turn to the peg, and immediately the
horse sprang upward and rose higher than the
roof of the palace, so that all the arrows fell
short and rained destruction on those that were
below.</p>

<p>Then the prince called to the King, "O King
of Bengal, have I not now proved myself worthy
to be thy son-in-law, and wilt thou not give me
the hand of thy daughter in marriage?" But
the King's wrath was very great, for he had been
made foolish in the eyes of his people, and panic
had broken the ranks of his army and many of
them were slain; and by no means would he
have for his son-in-law one that possessed such
power to throw down the order and establishment
of his kingdom. So he cried back to the
prince, saying, "O vile enchanter, get hence as
thou valuest thy life, for if ever thou darest to
return and set foot within my dominions thy
death and not my daughter shall be thy reward!"
Thus he spoke in his anger, forgetting altogether
the promise he had made.</p>

<p>Now it should be known that all this time the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>princess had been watching the combat from the
roof of the palace; and as her fear and anxiety for
the prince had in the first instance been great, so
now was she overjoyed when she saw him rise
superior to the dangers which had threatened
him. But as soon as she heard her father's
words she became filled with fresh fear lest she
and her lover were now to be parted; so as the
prince came speeding by upon the magic horse
she stretched up her arms to him, crying, "O
master of the flying bird, leave me not desolate,
for if thou goest from me now I shall die."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl32"></a><a href="images/lg_pl32.jpg">
<img src="images/pl32.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">All this time the Princess had been
watching the combat from the roof of the palace.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>No sooner did Prince Firouz Schah hear those
words than he checked his steed in its flight,
and swooping low he bore down over the palace
roof, and catching the princess up in his arms
placed her upon the saddle before him; and
straightway at the pressure of its rider the horse
rose under them and carried them away high in
air, so that they disappeared forthwith from the
eyes of the King and his people.</p>

<p>But as they travelled the day grew hot and the
sun burned fiercely upon them; and the prince
looking down beheld a green meadow by the side
of a lake; so he said, "O desire of my heart, let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>us go down into yonder meadow and seek rest
and refreshment, and there let us wait till it is
evening, so that we may come unperceived to my
fathers palace; and when I have brought thee
thither safely and secretly, then will I make
preparation so that thou mayest appear at my
fathers court in such a manner as befits thy
rank."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl33"></a><a href="images/lg_pl33.jpg">
<img src="images/pl33.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">In the garden of the summer palace all
was silence and solitude.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>So the princess consenting, they went down
and sat by the lake and solaced themselves
sweetly with love till it was evening. Then
they rose up and mounted once more upon the
magic horse and came by night to the outskirts
of the city where dwelt the King of Persia. Now
in the garden of the summer palace which stood
without the walls all was silence and solitude,
and coming thither unperceived the King's son
led the princess to a pavilion, the door of which
lay open, and placing before it the magic horse
he bade her stay within and keep watch till his
messenger should come to take her to the palace
which he would cause to be prepared for her.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<img src="images/pl34.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Sat by the lake and solaced themselves
sweetly with love.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Leaving her thus safely sheltered, the prince
went in to the city to present himself before the
King his father; and there he found him in deep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>mourning and affliction because of his son's
absence; and his father seeing him, rose up and
embraced him tenderly, rejoicing because of his
safe return, and eager to know in what way he had
fared. And the prince said, "O my father, if it
be thy good will and pleasure, I have come
back to thee far richer than I went. For I have
brought with me the fairest princess that the
eyes of love have ever looked upon, and she is the
daughter of the King of Bengal; and because of
my love for her and the great service which
she rendered me when I was a stranger in the
midst of enemies, therefore have I no heart or
mind or will but to win your consent that I may
marry her." And when the King heard that, and
of all that the princess had done, and of how
they had escaped together, he gave his consent
willingly, and ordered that a palace should be
immediately got ready for her reception that she
might on the next day appear before the people
in a manner befitting her rank.</p>

<p>Then while preparation was going forward,
the prince sought news concerning the sage, for
he feared that the King might have slain him.
"Do not speak of him," cried the King. "Would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>to Heaven that I had never set eyes on him or his
invention, for out of this has arisen all my
grief and lamentation. Therefore he now lies in
prison awaiting death."</p>

<p>"Nay," said the prince "now surely should he
be released and suitably rewarded, seeing that
unwittingly he hath been the cause of my
fortune; but do not give him my sister in
marriage."</p>

<p>So the King sent and caused the Indian to be
brought before him clad in a robe of rank. And
the King said to him, "Because my son, whom
thy vile invention carried away from me, hath
returned safe and sound, therefore will I spare
thy life. And for the reward of thine ingenuity I
give thee this robe of honour; but now take thy
horse, wherever it may be, and go, nor ever appear
in my sight again. And if thou wilt marry, seek
one of thine own rank, but do not aspire to the
daughters of kings."</p>

<p>When the Indian heard that, he dissembled his
rage, and bowing himself to the earth departed
from the King's presence. And, as he went,
everywhere in the palace ran the tale how the
King's son had returned upon the magic horse,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>bringing with him a princess of most marvellous
beauty, and how they had alighted in the gardens
of the summer palace that lay outside the walls.</p>

<p>Now when this was told him the Indian at
once saw his opportunity, and going forth from
the city in haste he arrived at the summer palace
before the messenger with the appointed retinue
which the prince and the King were sending. So
coming to the pavilion in the garden he found
the princess waiting within, and before the door
the horse of ivory and ebony. Then was his heart
uplifted for joy, the more so when he perceived how
far the damsel exceeded in loveliness all that had
been told of her. Entering the chamber where
she sat he kissed the ground at her feet; and she,
seeing one that wore a robe of office making
obeisance before her, speak to him without fear,
saying, "Who art thou?"</p>

<p>The sage answered, "O moon of beauty, I am
but the dust which lies upon the road by which
thou art to travel. Yet I come as a messenger
from the King's son who hath sent me to bring
thee with all speed to a chamber in the royal
palace where he now awaits thee."</p>

<p>Now the Indian was of a form altogether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>hideous and abominable. The princess looked
at him, therefore, in surprise, saying, "Could not
the King's son find any one to send to me but
thee?" The sage laughed, for he read the
meaning of her words. "O searcher of hearts,"
he said, "do not wonder that the prince hath
sent to thee a man whose looks are unattractive,
for because of his love toward thee
he is grown exceeding jealous. Were it otherwise,
I doubt not that he would have chosen
the highest and most honourable in the land;
but, being what I am, he has preferred to
make me his messenger."</p>

<p>When the princess heard that, she believed
him, and because her impatience to be with her
lover was great, she yielded herself willingly into
his hands. Then the sage mounted upon the
horse and took up the damsel behind him; and
having bound her to his girdle for safety, he
turned the pin so swiftly that immediately they
rose up into the air far above the roof of the
palace and in full view of the royal retinue which
was even then approaching.</p>

<p>Now because his desire to be with his beloved
was so strong, the prince himself had come forth
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>before all others to meet her; and when he saw
her thus carried away captive, he uttered a loud
cry of lamentation, and stretched out his hands
toward her. The cry of her lover reached the
ears of the princess, and looking down she saw
with wonder his gestures of grief and despair.
So she said to the Indian, "O slave, why art
thou bearing me away from thy lord, disobeying
his command?" The sage answered, "He is
not my lord, nor do I owe him any duty or
obedience. May Heaven repay on him all the
grief he has brought on me, for I was the maker
of this horse on which he won thee, and because
he stole it from me I was cast into prison. But
now for all my wrongs I will take full payment,
and will torture his heart as he hath tortured
mine. Be of good cheer, therefore, for doubt not
that presently I shall seem a more desirable
lover in thine eyes than ever he was."</p>

<p>On hearing these words the princess was so
filled with terror and loathing that she endeavoured
to cast herself from the saddle; but the
Indian having bound her to his girdle, no present
escape from him was possible.</p>

<p>The horse had meanwhile carried them far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>from the city of the King of Persia, and it was
yet an early hour after dawn when they arrived
over the land of Cashmire. Assured that he was
now safe from pursuit, and perceiving an uninhabited
country below him, the Indian caused
the horse to descend on the edge of a wood
bordered by a stream. Here he made the princess
dismount, and was proceeding to force upon
her his base and familiar attentions, when the
cries raised by the princess drew to that spot
a party of horsemen who had been hunting in
the neighbourhood. The leader of the party,
who chanced to be no other than the Sultan of
that country, seeing a fair damsel undergoing
ill-treatment from one of brutish and malevolent
aspect, rode forward and demanded of the Indian
by what right he so used her. The sage boldly
declared that she was his wife and that how he used
her was no man's business but his own. The
damsel, however, contradicted his assertion with
indignation and scorn, and so great were her
beauty and the dignity of her bearing that her
statement of the case had only to be heard to
be believed. The Sultan therefore ordered the
Indian to be bound and beaten, and afterwards
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>to be led away to the adjacent city and there
cast into the deepest dungeon. As for the
princess and magic horse, he caused them to
be brought to the palace; and there for the
damsel he provided a magnificent apartment
with slaves and attendants such as befitted
her rank; but the horse, whose properties
remained secret, since no other use for it could
be discovered, was placed in the royal treasury.</p>

<p>Now though the princess was full of joy
over her escape from the Indian, and of gratitude
to her deliverer, she could not fail to read in the
Sultan's manner towards her the spell cast by
her beauty. And, in fact, no later than the
next day, awakened by sounds throughout the
whole city of tumult and rejoicing, and inquiring
as to the reason, she was informed that these
festivities were the prelude to her own nuptials
with the Sultan which were to be celebrated that
very day before sundown.</p>

<p>At this news her consternation was so great
that she immediately swooned away, and remained
for a long while speechless. But no
sooner had she recovered possession of her
faculties than her resolution was formed, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>when the Sultan entered, as is customary on
such occasions, to present his compliments and
make inquiries as to her health, she fell into an
extravagance of attitude and speech, so artfully
contrived that all who beheld her became convinced
of her insanity. And the more surely
to effect her purpose, and at the same time to
relieve her feelings, she made a violent attack
upon the Sultan's person; nor did she desist until
she had brought him to recognize that all hopes
for the present consummation of the nuptials were
useless.</p>

<p>On the following day also, and upon every succeeding
one, the princess showed the same violent
symptoms whenever the Sultan approached her.
It was in vain that all the wisest physicians in
the country were summoned into consultation.
While some declared that her malady was
curable, others, to whose word the princess by
her actions lent every possible weight, declared
that it was incurable; and in no case was any
remedy applied that did not seem immediately
to aggravate the disorder.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

</div>
<p class="caption">It was in vain that all the wisest physicians

<hr class="r35" />

<p>And here for a while we must leave the princess
and return to Prince Firouz Schah, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>affliction no words can describe. Unable to
endure the burden of his beloved one's absence
in the splendours of his father's palace, or to
leave her the victim of fate without an attempt
at rescue, he put on the disguise of a travelling
dervish, and departing secretly from the Persian
court set out into the world to seek for her.</p>

<p>For many months he travelled without clue
or tidings to guide him; but as Heaven ever
bestows favour on constancy in love, so it led
him at last to the land of Cashmire, and to the
city of its Sultan. Now as he drew near to it by
the main road, he fell into conversation with a
certain merchant, and inquired of him as to the
city and the life and conditions of its inhabitants.
And the merchant looked at him in surprise,
saying, "Surely you have come from a far
country not to have heard of the strange things
which have happened here, for everywhere in
these regions and among all the caravans goes the
story of the strange maiden, and the ebony horse,
and the waiting nuptials."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl36"></a><a href="images/lg_pl36.jpg">
<img src="images/pl36.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">For many months he travelled without clue.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Now when the prince heard that, he knew
that the end of his wanderings was in sight: so
looking upon the city with eyes of gladness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>"Tell me," he said, "for I know none of these
things." So the merchant told him truly all
that has here been narrated; and having ended
he said, "O dervish, though you are young,
you have in your eyes the light of wisdom; and
if you have also in your hands the power of
healing, then I tell you that in this city fortune
awaits you, for the Sultan will give even the
half of his kingdom to any man that shall
restore health of mind to this damsel."</p>

<p>Then the King's son felt his heart uplifted
within him, howbeit he knew well that the
fortune he sought would not be of the Sultan's
choosing; so parting from the merchant, he
put on the robe of a physician, and went and
presented himself at the palace.</p>

<p>The Sultan was glad at his coming, for though
many physicians had promised healing and
had all failed, still each new arrival gave him
fresh hopes. Now as the sight of a physician
seemed ever greatly to increase the princess's
malady, the Sultan led him to a small closet
or balcony, that thence he might look upon her
unperceived. So Prince Firouz Schah, having
travelled so many miles in search of her, saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>his beloved seated in deep despondency by the
side of a fountain; and ever with the tears
falling down from her eyes she sighed and
sang. Now when he heard her voice and the
words, and beheld the soft grief of her countenance,
then the prince knew that her disorder was
only feigned; and he went forth and said to
the Sultan, "This malady is curable; but for
the cure something is yet lacking. Let me go in
and speak with the damsel alone, and on my life
I promise that if all be done according to my
requirements, before this time to-morrow the cure
shall be accomplished."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>At these words the Sultan rejoiced greatly,
and he ordered the doors of the princess's chamber
to be opened to the physician. So Firouz Schah
passed in, and he and his beloved were alone
together. Now because of his grief and wanderings
and the growth of his beard, the face of the
prince was so changed that the princess did not
know him; but seeing one before her in the dress
of a physician she rose up in pretended frenzy
and began to throw herself about with violence,
until from utter exhaustion she fell prostrate.
Thereupon the prince drew near, and called her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>gently by name; and immediately when she
heard his voice she knew him, and uttered a loud
cry. Then the king's son put his mouth to her
ear and said "O temptation of all hearts, now spare
my life and have patience, for surely I am come
to save thee; but if the Sultan learn who I am
we are dead, thou and I, because his jealousy
is great." So she replied, saying, "O thou that
bringest me life, tell me what I shall do?" The
prince said, "When I depart hence let it appear
that I have restored to thee the possession of thy
faculties; howbeit the full cure is to come after.
Therefore when the Sultan comes to thee, be
sad and meek and do not repulse him as thou
hast done aforetime. Yet have no fear but that I
will keep thee safe from him to the last." And
so saying he left the princess and returned to the
Sultan, and said to him, "Go in and see whether
the cure be not already at work; but approach
not near to her, for though the genie that possessed
her is bound he is not yet cast forth:
nevertheless to-morrow before noon the remedy
shall be complete."</p>

<p>So the Sultan went and found her even as he
had been told; and with joy and gratitude he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>returned to Firouz Schah, saying, "Truly thou
art a healer and the rest are but bunglers and
fools. Now, therefore, give orders and all shall
be done according to thy will. Doubt not that
thy reward shall be great."</p>

<p>Then the prince said, "Let the horse of ivory
and ebony which was with her at the first be
brought forth and set again in the place where
it was found, and let the damsel also be brought
and put into my hand; and it shall be that when
I have set her upon the horse, then the evil
genie that held her shall be suddenly loosed,
passing from her into that which was aforetime
his place of bondage. So shall the remedy be
complete, and the princess find joy in her lord
before the eyes of all."</p>

<p>Now when the Sultan heard that, the mystery
of the ebony horse seemed plain to him, and its
use manifest. Therefore he gave orders that
with all speed the thing should be done as the
physician of the princess required it.</p>

<p>So early on the morrow they brought the horse
from the royal treasury, and the princess from
her chamber, and carried them to the place where
they were first found; and all about, a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>crowd of the populace was gathered to behold the
sight. Then Prince Firouz Schah took the
princess and set her upon the horse, and leaping
into the saddle before her he turned the pin of
ascent, and immediately the horse rose with a
great sound into the air, and hung above the heads
of the affrighted populace. And the King's son
leaned down from the saddle and cried in a loud
voice, "O Sultan of Cashmire, when you wish
to espouse princesses which seek your protection,
learn first to obtain their consent." And so
saying he put the horse to its topmost speed,
and like an arrow on the wind he and the
princess were borne away, and passed and
vanished, and were no more seen in that land.</p>

<p>But in the city of the King of Persia great joy
and welcome and thanksgiving awaited them; and
there without delay the nuptials were solemnized
and through all the country the people rejoiced
and feasted for a full month. But because of
the grief and affliction that it had caused him
the King broke the ebony horse and destroyed
its motions. As for the maker thereof, the
Sultan of Cashmire caused him to be put to a
cruel death: and thus is the story of the sage
and his invention brought to a full ending.</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE WICKED HALF-BROTHERS</h2>

<p class="p2">In the city of Harran there once lived a King who
had every happiness which life and fortune could
bestow save that he lacked an heir. Although,
according to royal custom, he had in his household
fifty wives, fair to look upon and affectionate
in disposition, and though he continually invoked
on these unions the blessing of Heaven, still he
remained childless; for which cause all his joy
was turned to affliction, and his wealth and
power and magnificence became as of no account.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Now one night as he slept there appeared
before him an old man of venerable appearance
who, addressing him in mild accents, spoke thus:
"The prayer of the faithful among fifty has been
heard. Arise, therefore and, go into the gardens
of your palace and cause the gardener to bring
you a pomegranate fully ripe. Eat as many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>the seeds as you desire children, and your wish
shall be fulfilled."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<img src="images/pl39.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Pirouzè, the fairest and most honourably born.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Immediately upon awaking the King remembered
the dream, and going down into the gardens
of the palace he took fifty pomegranate seeds, and
counting them one by one ate them all. So in
due course according to the promise of his
dream, each of his wives gave birth to a son
all about the same time. To this, however, there
was an exception, for one of the fifty whose
name was Pirouzè, the fairest and the most
honourably born, she alone, as time went on,
showed no sign of that which was expected of
her. Then was the King's anger kindled against
her because in her alone the promise of his dream
was not fulfilled; and deeming such a one hateful
in the eyes of Heaven he was minded to put
her to death. His vizier, however, dissuaded
him. "Time alone can show," said he, "whether
her demerits are so great as you now suppose.
Let her go back to her own people and remain in
banishment until the will of Heaven shall declare
itself, and if within due time she give birth to a
son then can she return to you with all honour."
So the King did as his vizier advised, and sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>Pirouzè back to her own country to the court of
the Prince of Samaria; and there before long she
who had seemed barren had the joy of becoming a
mother and gave birth to a son whom she named
Codadad, that is to say, "the Gift of God."
Nevertheless, because the King of Harran had
put upon her so public a disgrace, the Prince of
Samaria would send no word to him of the
event; so the young Prince was brought up at his
uncle's court, and there he learned to ride and
to shoot and to perform such warlike feats as
become a prince, and in all that country he had
no equal for accomplishment or courage.</p>

<p>Now one day, when Codadad had reached the
age of eighteen, word came to him that his father
the King of Harran was engaged in war and
surrounded by enemies; so the Prince said to his
mother, "Now is it time that I should go and
prove myself worthy of my birth and the equal of
my brethren; for here in Samaria all is peace
and indolence, but in Harran are hardship and
dangers, and great deeds waiting to be done."
And his mother said to him, "O my son, since it
seems good to thee, go; but how wilt thou
declare thyself to thy father, or cause him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>believe thy word, seeing that he is ignorant of
thy birth?" Codadad answered, "I will so
declare myself by my deeds that before my father
knows the truth he shall wish that it were true."</p>

<p>So he departed and came in princely arms to
the city of Harran, and there offered his service
to the King against all his enemies. Now, no
sooner had the King looked upon the youth than
his heart was drawn toward him because of his
beauty and the secret ties of blood, but when he
asked from what country he came, Codadad
answered, "I am the son of an emir of Cairo, and
wherever there is war I go to win fame, nor do I
care in what cause I fight so long as I be
proved worthy."</p>

<p>The Prince was not slow in making his valour
known; before long he had risen to the command
of the whole army, not only over the heads of his
brethren but also of the more experienced officers.
And thereafter, when peace was re-established,
the King, finding Codadad as prudent as he
was valiant, appointed him governor to the young
Princes.</p>

<p>Now this act, though justified by merit, could
not fail to increase the hatred and jealousy which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>Codadad's brethren had long felt towards him.
"What?" they cried, "shall this stranger not
only steal from us the first place in the King's
favour, but must we also be in obedience to his
ruling and judgment? Surely if we do so we
are no sons of a King."</p>

<p>So they conspired together how best to be rid of
him. One said, "Let us fall upon him with our
swords." "No, no," said another, "for so doing
we shall but bring punishment upon ourselves.
But let us so arrange matters as to draw on him
the weight of the King's anger; thus shall our
vengeance be made both safe and complete."</p>

<p>To this the other Princes agreed; so forming a
design which seemed favourable to their end they
approached Codadad, and besought his permission
to go forth together on a hunting expedition,
promising to return the same day. Codadad,
deeming the request reasonable, immediately
granted it: the brothers departed, but they did
not return.</p>

<p>On the third day the King made inquiry as to
the reason of their absence. Codadad replied
that they were gone on a hunting expedition but
had promised to return much sooner. Another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>day passed and the King grew anxious; yet
another, and he became furious; and all his
wrath was directed against Codadad. "O traitor,"
he cried, "why has thou neglected thy trust and
allowed my sons to go anywhere unaccompanied
by thee? Now go instantly and search for them,
and if thou find them not be assured that on thy
head shall fall the penalty."</p>

<p>At these words the Prince was filled with
sudden foreboding, for he knew that the brothers
had no love for him, and well could he see now
the danger into which he had fallen. All he
could do, however, was to obey; so furnishing
himself with arms and a horse good for travelling,
he set out in search of his brethren.</p>

<p>After some days employed in a fruitless quest
he came to a desolate tract in the midst of which
stood a castle of black marble. As he approached
he beheld at an upper window a damsel of
marvellous beauty, with torn garments, dishevelled
hair, and a countenance expressive of
the most lively affliction, who immediately that
she set eyes on him wrung her hands and waived
him away crying "Oh, fly, fly from this place of
death and the monster which inhabits it! For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>here lives a black giant which feeds on human
flesh, seizing all he can find. Even now in his
dungeons you may hear the cries of those whom
for his next meal he will devour."</p>

<p>"Madam," replied the Prince, "for my safety
you need have no care. Only be good enough to
inform me who you are and how you came to be
in your present plight." "I come from Cairo,"
she replied, "where my birth gives me rank.
And as I was travelling from thence on my road
to Bagdad this monstrous negro suddenly fell
upon us, and having slain my escort brought me
hither a captive, to endure, if Heaven refuses me
succour, things far worse than death. But
though I know my own peril I will not see
others perish in a vain attempt to rescue me,
therefore once more I entreat you to fly ere it be
too late!"</p>

<p>But even as she spoke, the negro, a horrible
and gigantic monster of loathsome appearance,
came in sight moving rapidly toward the palace.
No sooner had he caught sight of the Prince than
he rushed upon him with growls of fury, and
drawing his scimitar aimed at him a blow which,
had it found him, must there and then have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>ended the fight. The Prince, however, swerved
nimbly under the stroke, and reaching his farthest,
wounded the giant in the knee; then wheeling
his charger about before the negro could turn on
his maimed limb he attacked him from the rear,
and with one fortunate blow brought him to
earth. Instantly, before the giant could gather
up his huge length and regain his vantage,
Codadad spurred forward and with a single
sweep of his sword smote off his head.</p>

<p class="caption">Reaching his farthest wounded the giant

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Meanwhile, all breathless above, the lady had
leaned watching the contest. Now, seeing that
victory was secured, she gave free vent to her
joy and gratitude. "O prince of men!" she cried,
"now is revealed to me the high rank to which
thou wast born. Finish, then, thy work; take
from the girdle of yonder wretch the keys of the
castle and come quickly to the release of me and
my fellow prisoners."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl41"></a><a href="images/lg_pl41.jpg">
<img src="images/pl41.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">The lady advanced to meet him.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The Prince did according to her directions; as
he opened the gates and entered the forecourt the
lady advanced to meet him, ready, had he permitted
it, to throw herself in gratitude at his
feet. And now, as he beheld near at hand the
beauty which had charmed him from a distance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Codadad realized how great had been his fortune,
and with his whole heart rejoiced at the deliverance
of one in whose nature so much virtue
and grace seemed blended.</p>

<p>But while he was thus lost in the contemplation
of her loveliness there arose from the basement
of the castle a dreadful sound of crying and
lamentation. "What is that?" inquired the
Prince. "It is the cry of the prisoners," replied
the lady, "to whom, I doubt not, the opening of
the gates has betokened the monster's return.
Come, therefore, quickly and relieve them of
their misery." And so saying she pointed to the
door which led to the place of confinement.</p>

<p>Thither, accompanied by the lady, went
Codadad with all speed. Descending by a dark
stair he came upon a vast cavern dimly lighted,
around the walls of which a hundred prisoners
lay chained. Instantly he set to work to loose
their bonds, informing them at the same time of
the death of their captor and of their freedom
from all further danger. At these unexpected
tidings the captives raised a cry of joy and
thanksgiving; but great as was their surprise at
such unlooked-for deliverance, greater still was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>that of the Prince when, on bringing them to the
light, he discovered that forty-nine of the hundred
whom he had released were his own brethren.</p>

<p>The Princes received the cordial embraces of
their deliverer with little embarrassment, for the
disaster into which they had fallen had caused
them almost entirely to forget their original
intent. Satisfied with expressing in proper terms
their obligation and gratitude toward Codadad,
they now joined eagerly in his survey of the
castle; there upon examination they found an
extraordinary variety and wealth of booty, consisting
for the most part of merchandise which the
negro had pillaged from passing caravans, some
of it actually belonging to those whom Codadad
had so recently rescued.</p>

<p>The Prince accordingly ordered the merchants
each to take what he recognized as his own;
and this being done he divided the rest
equally between them. The question then arose
how they should remove their plunder from a
place so desolately situated, where it would seem
impossible to procure means of conveyance; but
on a further search they found not only the
camels of the merchants, but also the horses on
which the Princes of Harran had ridden; and as,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>at their approach the black slaves who were in
charge of the stables fell into headlong flight,
Codadad and his companions found themselves
left in undisputed possession. The merchants
therefore loaded their camels, and with renewed
protestations of gratitude departed on the several
roads by which their avocations called them.</p>

<p>When they were gone Codadad's next care was
to inquire of the lady in what direction she
wished to travel, promising that he and the
Princes would conduct her in safety to any place
she might name. The lady replied, thanking
him for his generous offer. "But wherever I
go," said she, "it cannot be to my own country,
for not only is it too far distant, but cruel misfortune
has separated me from it for ever. And
since you have put me under so great an obligation,
let me now confess the truth which before
I thought it prudent to conceal. My dignity of
rank is far higher than that to which I recently
laid claim; in me you behold a King's daughter,
and if it will interest you to hear the story of
my misfortunes, I shall be happy to recount it."
Assured of the lively sympathy of her auditors
she began as follows:</p>

<h2>THE STORY OF THE PRINCESS OF DERYABAR</h2>

<hr class="r35" />

</div>
<p class="caption">A city among the Isles named Deryabar.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>My father was the King of a city among the
isles named Deryabar, and I was his only child;
for, in spite of his many prayers directed to that
end, Heaven had not granted him a son.
And for this cause, though he bestowed upon
my education all imaginable care, the sight of
me remained displeasing to him. In order the
better to forget his sorrow he spent his days in
hunting, and so he chanced on the event which
led to all our misfortunes. For one day, as he
was riding unattended in the forest, night overtook
him and he knew not which way to turn.
Presently in the distance he perceived a light,
and advancing towards it he came upon a hut
within which a monstrous negro stood basting
an ox that roasted before the fire. In the
further corner of the hut lay a beautiful woman
with hands bound, and a face betokening the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>deepest affliction, while at her feet a young child,
between two and three years of age, stretched
up its arms and wailed without ceasing.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl43"></a><a href="images/lg_pl43.jpg">
<img src="images/pl43.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">Presently in the distance he perceived a light.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>At this sight my father was filled with compassion,
but his desire to effect her rescue was
restrained for a while by fear that a failure
might only make matters worse. In the meantime
the giant, having drained a pitcher of wine,
sat down to eat. Presently he turned himself
about and addressed the lady. "Charming
Princess," said he, "why will you not accept the
good things which are within your reach? Only
yield to me the love that I demand and you will
find in me the gentlest and most considerate of
lords." To these advances, however, the lady
replied with resolution and courage. "Vile
monster," she cried, "every time I look at you
does but increase my hatred and loathing toward
you. Unchangeable as the foulness of your
appearance is the disgust with which you inspire
me!"</p>

<p>These words of violent provocation were no
sooner uttered than the negro, beside himself
with rage, drew his sword, and seizing the lady
by the hair, lifted her from the ground in preparation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>for the blow that would have ended all.
Whereupon, seeing that not a moment was to be
lost, my father drew his bow and let fly an
arrow with so good an aim that pierced to the
heart the giant fell dead. Immediately entering
the hut my father raised the lady from the
swoon into which she had fallen, and severing
her bonds gave her the needed reassurance that
all danger was now over. Before long he
learned in answer to his inquiries that she had
been wife to a chief of the Saracens, in whose
service the slain giant had, on account of his
great strength, occupied a position of trust.
This, however, he had shamelessly betrayed; for
having conceived a violent passion for his master's
wife, he first persuaded the chief into an expedition
which terminated in his death, and then
returning in haste carried away by force not only
the lady but her child also. From this degrading
bondage my father's act had now saved her;
but though thus relieved of immediate danger, the
wife of the Saracen chief was both solitary and
friendless, for not only was she too far removed
from her own land to return to it unaided, but
she had small hope, should she ever arrive there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>of securing for her son his rightful inheritance.
This being the case my father, moved with
compassion, determined to adopt the child as
his own; and as the lady gratefully accepted his
proposal, the next day as soon as it was light he
returned to Deryabar bringing with him mother
and son.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the son of a Saracen
chief was brought up in my father's palace like
a Prince of the blood royal; and so, on attaining
to manhood, having both grace and good looks
to recommend him, he came to forget the comparative
lowliness of his origin, and aspiring to
become my father's heir, had the presumption
to demand my hand in marriage.</p>

<p>A claim so audacious merited the severest
punishment, yet my father merely remarked that
he had other views concerning me, and with
so lenient a rebuke would have passed the matter
by. His refusal, however, excited in the proud
youth the liveliest resentment; seeing that he could
not obtain his ambition by fair means he immediately
entered into conspiracy, and having
treacherously slain my father, caused himself to be
made King in his place. Fresh from this monstrous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>crime he renewed his suit for my hand, and
was preparing to enforce it by violence, when the
vizier, who alone of all my fathers court had
remained faithful to his memory, found means
to convey me from the palace to a sailing
vessel which was leaving harbour the same
night.</p>

<p class="caption">The ship struck upon a rock.</p>

<hr class="r35" />
<p>Here for a time I seemed to have reached
safety, but when we had been only three days at
sea a violent storm arose, and the ship, driving
helplessly before it, struck upon a rock and went
down leaving as sole survivor the one who least
wished to be spared. How I was saved I know
not, nor how long I lay unfriended by the
desolate shore upon which I had been cast; but
scarcely had the consciousness of life returned
to me when I heard a multitudinous sound of
swift galloping; and presently, feeling myself
lifted by men's hands, I turned and saw halting
near me a troop of Arab horsemen, and at
their head a youth royally arrayed and beautiful
as the morning. Thus when my fortunes
were at their lowest I beheld him whom Heaven
had sent not only to afford me that deliverance
of which I stood so much in need, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>also to restore me to the rank due to my
birth. For let me confess that after this young
Prince had succoured me with the most tender
solicitude, conducting me in all honour to his
own palace and there lodging me under his
mother's protection, I experienced towards him a
feeling of duty and gratitude such as would have
made his lightest wish my law. When therefore
with an ardent and ever increasing devotion he
desired me to become his bride, I could not,
upon the completion of my recovery, refuse him
the happiness he sought.</p>

<p class="caption">And presently, feeling myself lifted by men's hands.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>But the festivities of our marriage were
scarcely ended, when suddenly by night the city
in which we dwelt was attacked by a band of
travelling marauders. The attack was so unexpected
and so well planned that the town
was stormed and the garrison cut to pieces
before any news of the event had reached the
palace. Under cover of darkness we managed
to escape, and fleeing to the sea shore took
refuge on a small fishing boat, in which we
immediately put out to sea, hoping to find in
the rude winds and waves a safer shelter than our
own walls had afforded us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>For two days we drifted with wind and tide,
not knowing any better direction in which to turn;
upon the third we perceived with relief a ship
bearing down upon us, but as we watched its
approach our satisfaction was soon changed to apprehension
and dread, for we saw clearly that those
on board were neither fishermen nor traders, but
pirates. With rude shouts they boarded our
small bark, and seizing my husband and myself
carried us captive to their own vessel. Here
the one who was their leader advanced towards
me and pulled aside my veil; whereupon a great
clamour instantly arose among the crew, each
contending for the possession of me. The dispute
upon this point grew so warm that presently
they fell to fighting; and a bitter and
deadly conflict was maintained till at last only a
single pirate was left. This one, who now regarded
himself as my owner, proceeded to inform
me of what was to be my fate. "I have," he said,
"a friend in Cairo who has promised me a rich
reward if I can supply him with a slave, more
beautiful than any of those that his harem now
contains. The distinction of earning me this
reward shall be yours." "But tell me," he went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>on, turning towards the place where my husband
stood bound, "who is this youth that accompanies
you? Is he a lover or a brother, or only
a servant?" "Sir," said, I "he is my husband."
"In that case" he replied, "out of pity we must
get rid of him, for I would not afflict him needlessly
with the sight of another's happiness."
And so saying, he took my husband, all bound
as he was, and threw him into the sea.</p>

<p>So great was my grief at the sight of this cruel
deed, that had I not been bound myself I should
undoubtedly have sought the same end to my
sufferings. But for the sake of future profit the
pirate took the most watchful care of me, not only
so long as we were on board the ship but also when,
a few days later, we came to port and there joined
ourselves to a large caravan which was about to
start on the road to Cairo. While thus travelling
in apparent safety, we were suddenly attacked
by the terrible negro who lately owned this
castle. After a long and dubious conflict the
pirate, and all who stood by him, were slain, while
I and those of the merchants who had remained
timorously looking on were seized, and brought
hither as prisoners destined as it seemed for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>fate far more lingering and terrible. The rest
of my story, brave Prince, I need not here recount,
since the shaping of it was so largely in
your own hands, and since to you alone is owed
the happiness of its conclusion.</p>

<p class="caption">The Princess of Deryabar.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>When the Princess of Deryabar had thus
finished the tale of her wanderings, Codadad
hastened to assure her how deep was his sympathy
in all her misfortunes. "But if you will
allow yourself," he continued, "to be guided by
me, your future life shall be one of safety and
tranquillity. You have but to come as my bride,
and the King of Harran will offer you an honourable
welcome to his court; while, as regards
myself, my whole life shall be devoted to securing
for you that happiness which your grace and
noble qualities prove that you deserve. And
that you may not regard this proposal as too
presumptuous, I have now to inform you, and
also these Princes, concerning my birth and
rank. For I, too, am a son of the King of Harran,
born to him at the court of Samaria by his wife
the Princess Pirouzè, whom he had sent unjustly
into banishment."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>This declaration on the part of Codadad so
accorded with the inclinations of the Princess
that she at once yielded her consent, and as the


castle was full of provisions suitable for the
occasion, preparations were made firstto solemnize
the marriage, and then for all together to set forth
on the return journey to Harran. As for the
Princes, though they received Codadad's news with
every outward protestation of joy, they were in fact
more filled with apprehension and jealousy than
before, for they could not but fear that his favour
with the King would be greatly increased and become
far more dangerous to their interests when
the true facts of his birth were revealed. No
sooner, therefore, had Codadad and the Princess
passed to their nuptials, than his brethren entered
into a conspiracy to slay him; and at the first halt
upon the homeward journey, taking advantage
of the lack of protection which a tent affords,
they came upon their brother by night, and stabbing
him in a hundred places as he lay asleep, left
him for dead in the arms of his bride. They then
broke up the camp and returned with all haste to
the city of Harran, where, with a falsely invented
tale they excused themselves to the King for
their long absence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>In the meantime Codadad lay so spent by loss
of blood that there remained in him no sign of
life. The Princess, his wife, distraught with
grief, had already given him up for dead. "O
Heaven," she cried, bathing his body with her
tears, "why am I thus ever condemned to bring
on others disaster and death, and why for a
second time have I been deprived of the one I was
about to love?"</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl47"></a><a href="images/lg_pl47.jpg">
<img src="images/pl47.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">She found to her grief the place where
Codadad had lain left vacant.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>As thus she continued to cry in piteous
lamentation, and to gaze on the senseless form
lying before her, she thought that she perceived
on the lips a faint motion of breath.
At once her hope revived, and springing to her
feet she ran instantly in the direction of the
nearest village, hoping to find there a surgeon or
one that had skill in the binding of wounds.
Returning after a time with the aid that she had
summoned she found to her grief the place where
Codadad had lain left vacant, nor was there any
trace or indication of the fate which had overtaken
him.</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by this final catastrophe, and
believing that some wild beast must have devoured
him, she suffered herself to be led away
by the surgeon, who, in pity for one so greatly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>afflicted, placed her under the shelter of his own
roof, and lavished upon her every mark of consideration
and respect. So, when she had sufficiently
recovered, for her griefs to find utterance
he gathered from her own lips all the circumstances
of her story, her name and rank, the
high and valiant deeds of the Prince her husband,
and the base ingratitude of his brethren.
And perceiving that her grief and sufferings
had so robbed her of the desire of life that
without some end on which to direct her will she
would presently pass into a decline, the surgeon
endeavoured to arouse her to the pursuit of that
just vengeance which the murder of her husband
had earned. "Do not" he said, "let the death
of so noble a Prince become a benefit to his
enemies. Let us go together to the King of
Harran, and make known to him the guilt of
these wicked brethren. For surely the name of
Codadad should live in story; but if you, whose
honour he saved, now sink under your affliction
his name perishes with you, and you have not
retrieved your debt."</p>

<p>These words roused the Princess from her
deep despondency; forming her resolution on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>the surgeon's advice, she arose instantly and
prepared herself for the journey, and with such
haste and diligence did she pursue her project,
that within two days she and her companion
arrived at the city of Harran.</p>

<p>Here strange news awaited them; for at all the
caravanseri it was told how lately there had come
to the city an exiled wife of the King, Princess
Pirouzè by name, enquiring for news of her lost
son; and how, asnow appeared, this son had already
been under a feigned designation at his father's
court, and after performing many exploits and
deeds of heroism had disappeared none knew
whither. Forty-nine sons had the King by
different wives, but all these, it was declared, he
would willingly put to death so only that Codadad
might be restored to him.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterl">
<a id="pl48"></a><a href="images/lg_pl48.jpg">
<img src="images/pl48.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">She and her companion arrived at the city of Harran.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Now when the Princess of Deryabar heard
this, she said, "I will go to the Queen Pirouzè
and make known to her the fate of her son, and
when we have wept together and drawn comfort
from each other in our grief then we will go before
the King, and demand vengeance on the
murderers." But the surgeon said, "Have a
care what you do; for if the Princes of Harran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>learn of your arrival, they will not rest till they
have done to you as they did to your husband.
Let us therefore proceed with secrecy, so as to
ensure safety, and do you on no account let your
presence here be known till the King has been
thoroughly informed of the whole matter." Then
leaving the Princess in a place discreetly chosen
he went forth into the streets and began to
direct his steps towards the palace. Presently
he was met by a lady mounted upon a mule
richly caparisoned, and behind her followed a
great troop of guards and attendants. As she
approached the populace ran out of their houses
and stood in rows to see her go by, and when
she passed all bowed down with their faces to the
earth. The surgeon inquired of a beggar stand-near
whether this was one of the King's wives.
"Yes, brother," replied the beggar, "and the best
of them all; for she is the mother of Prince
Codadad, whom, now that he is lost, all hold
in love and reverence. And thus each day she
goes to the mosque to hear the prayers which
the King has ordered for her son's safe return."</p>

<p>Seeing his course now clear the surgeon went
and stood at the door of the mosque, waiting the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>Queen's departure, and when she came forth with
all her attendants he plucked one of them by the
sleeve and said to him, "If the Queen would
have news of her son, Prince Codadad, let her send
for the stranger who will be found waiting at the
door of her palace." So, as soon as Pirouzè had
returned to her apartments, the slave went in and
gave his mistress the message. Then she sent
in all haste and caused the surgeon to be brought
before her. And the surgeon prostrated himself
and said, "O Queen, let not the grief of the tidings
which I bear be visited upon me but on them
that were the cause of it." And she answered
him, "Have peace, and say on!" So he told
her, as has been here set forth, the full story of
all the courage and prowess of Codadad, and of
his generosity towards his brethren, also of his
marriage to the Princess of Deryabar and of what
followed after. But when he came to speak of
the slaying of her son, the tender mother, as
though receiving in her own body the strokes of
the murderers fell forward upon the ground, and
there for a while lay motionless without sign of
life. When however the surgeon, aided by her
women, had restored her to consciousness, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>Pirouzè, putting aside all personal grief, set her
mind upon the accomplishment of the duty which
now lay before her. "Go instantly," she said, "and
tell the Princess of Deryabar that the King will
shortly receive her with all the honour due to
her rank. As for yourself, be assured that your
services will be remembered."</p>

<p>Hardly had the surgeon departed, when the
King himself entered, and the sight of his Queen's
deep affliction at once informed him that something
dreadful must have occurred. "Alas," she
cried, "our son no longer exists, nor is it even
possible to pay to his body those last rites which
were due to his rank and virtue, for stricken by
treacherous hands and left to perish unprotected
he has fallen a prey to wild beasts so that not
a trace of him remains." She then proceeded to
inform her husband of all the horrible circumstances
which the surgeon had narrated.</p>

<p>But before she had ended the King became so
transported with rage and grief that he could no
longer delay the setting in motion of his just
vengeance. Repairing in haste to the hall of
audience, where courtiers and suitors stood
waiting, he summoned to him his grand vizier
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>with so much fury of countenance that all
trembled for their lives. "Go instantly," he
cried, "arrest all the Princes, and convey them
under a strong guard to the prison assigned for
murderers!" The vizier, not daring to question
an order so terribly uttered, went forth and
fulfilled the King's command with all speed. On
his return to the palace for the presentation of
his report, a further order almost equally surprising
awaited him. The King described to him a
certain inn lying in a poor quarter of the city.
"Go thither," said he, "take with you slaves
and high attendants, a white mule from the royal
stables, and a guard of honour, and bring hither
with all the respect due to her rank the young
Princess whom you shall find there."</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterl">
<a id="pl49"></a><a href="images/lg_pl49.jpg">
<img src="images/pl49.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">And taking her hand he led her to the
apartments of the Queen Pirouzè.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>The vizier, with revived spirits, went forth to
fulfil this second mission, so much more agreeable
to him than the first; and presently there arose
from the streets leading to the palace the acclamations
of the populace because of the magnificence
and splendour which announced the arrival of
the unknown Princess. The King, as a token
of respect, stood waiting at the palace gates to
receive her, and taking her hand he led her to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>apartments of the Queen Pirouzè. Here at the
meeting of mother and wife a scene of the most
tender and heart-rending affliction took place.
The King himself was so moved by it that he
had not the heart to refuse to them any request.
So when they came and besought for the absent
those funeral honours which under other circumstances
would have been his due, he gave
orders for a dome of marble to be erected on the
plain by which the city of Harran lies surrounded.
And with such speed was the work put in hand,
and so large was the number of men employed
upon it, that within three days the entire building
was completed.</p>

<p>On the day following the obsequies began.
All was done with the greatest solemnity and
splendour. First came the King attended by
his vizier and all the officers and lords of his
palace; and entering the tomb, in which lay an
effigy of Codadad, they seated themselves on
carpets of mourning bordered with gold. Then
followed the chiefs of the army mounted upon
horses and bewailing the loss of him who had
led them to victory; behind these came old men
upon black mules, with long robes and flowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>beards; and after these maidens on white horses,
with heads unveiled, bearing in their hands
baskets of precious stones. Now when these
had approached and compassed the dome three
times about, then the King rose up to speak the
dismissal of the dead. Touching with his brow
the tomb whereon the effigy lay, he cried in a
loud voice, "O my dear son, O light of mine
eyes, O joy that is lost to me for ever." After
him all the lords and the chiefs and the elders
came and prostrated themselves in like manner;
and when the ceremony was ended the doors
of the tomb were shut and all the people returned
to the city.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<div class="figcenterp">
<a id="pl50"></a><a href="images/lg_pl50.jpg">
<img src="images/pl50.jpg" alt="" /></a>
</div>
<p class="caption">After these, maidens on white horses, with
heads unveiled, bearing in their hands baskets of precious stones.</p>

<hr class="r35" />

<p>Now after this there was prayer and fasting in
the mosque for eight days, and on the ninth the
King gave orders that the Princes were to be beheaded.
But meanwhile the neighbouring powers,
whose arms the King of Harran had defeated, as
soon as they heard that Codadad was dead, banded
themselves together in strong alliance, and with
a great host began to advance upon the city.
Then the King caused the execution to be postponed,
and making a hasty levy of his forces
went forth to meet the enemy in the open plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>And there battle was joined with such valour and
determination on both sides that for a time the
issue remained doubtful. Nevertheless, because
the men of Harran were fewer in number they
began to be surrounded by their enemies; but
at the very moment when all seemed lost they
saw in the distance a large body of horsemen
advancing at the charge; and while both combatants
were yet uncertain of their purpose, these
fell furiously and without warning upon the
ranks of the allies, and throwing them into
sudden disorder drove them in rout from the
field.</p>

<p>With the success of their arms thus established
the two leaders of the victorious forces
advanced to meet each other in the presence of
the whole army, and great was the joy and
astonishment of the King when he discovered in
the leader of the lately-arrived troop his lost son
Codadad. The Prince, for his part, was equally
delighted to find in his father's welcome the
recognition for which he had yearned.</p>

<p>When the long transport of their meeting
embrace was over, the Prince, as they began to
converse, perceived with surprise how much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>was already known to the King of past events.
"What?" he inquired, "has one of my brothers
awakened to his guilt, and confessed that which
I had meant should ever remain a secret?"
"Not so," replied the King, "from the Princess
of Deryabar alone have I learned the truth. For
she it was who came to demand vengeance for
the crime which your brothers would still have
concealed."</p>

<p>At this unlooked-for news of the safety of the
Princess and of her arrival at his father's court,
Codadad's joy was beyond words, and greatly
was it increased when he heard of his mother's
reinstatement in the King's favour with the
honour and dignity due to her rank. He now
began to perceive how events had shaped themselves
in his absence, and how the King had
already become informed of the bond that existed
between them. As for the rest of his adventures,
together with the circumstance which had led to his
disappearance and supposed death, they were soon
explained. For when the Princess had left Codadad
in her desperate search for aid, there chanced
that way a travelling pedlar; and he, finding the
youth apparently deserted and dying of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>wounds, took pity on him, and placing him upon
his mule bore him to his own house. There
with medicinal herbs and simple arts unknown in
the palaces of kings he had accomplished a cure
which others would have thought impossible, so
that in a short time Codadad's strength was completely
restored. Thereupon the Prince impatient
for reunion with those whom he loved, bestowed
on the pedlar all the wealth that he possessed, and
immediately set forth toward the city of Harran.</p>

<p>On the road news reached him of the fresh outbreak
of hostilities followed by the invasion of his
father's territory. Passing from village to village
he roused and armed the inhabitants, and by
the excellence of his example made such soldiers
of them that they were able in the fortunate
moment of their arrival to decide the issue of
the conflict and give victory to the King's arms.</p>

<p>"And now, sire," said the Prince in conclusion,
"I have only one request to make:
since in the event all things have turned out
so happily, I beg you to pardon my brothers in
order that I may prove to them in the future how
groundless were the resentment and jealousy
that they felt toward me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>These generous sentiments drew tears from
the King's eyes and removed from his mind all
doubt as to the wisdom of the resolution he had
been forming. Immediately before the assembled
army he declared Codadad his heir, and, as an act
of grace to celebrate his son's return, gave orders
for the Princes to be released. He then led
Codadad with all speed to the palace, where
Pirouzè and her daughter-in-law were anxiously
awaiting them.</p>

<p>In the joy of that meeting the Prince and his
wife were repaid a thousandfold for all the griefs
and hardships they had undergone: and their
delight in each other's society remained so great
that in all the world no happiness has been known
to equal it. The Princes half died of shame
when the means by which their pardon had been
procured was revealed to them; but before long
the natural insensibility of their characters reasserted
itself and they recovered.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
